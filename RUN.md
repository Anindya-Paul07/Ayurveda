# Running the Ayurvedic Recommender Project

This document provides step-by-step instructions to set up and run the Ayurvedic Recommender project locally with the new weather-based feature enabled, as well as instructions for running the test suites.

## Initial Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anindya2369/ayurveda.git
   
   # Navigate to the project root
   cd ayurveda
   ```
   
   > Note: If you have already cloned the repository, you can skip this step and simply navigate to the project directory.

## Overview

- **Project Structure**: The project consists of a React frontend and a Flask backend, organized in separate 'frontend' and 'back' directories within the ayurveda directory.
- **New Feature**: Weather-based Ayurvedic recommendations are integrated into the frontend (see `components/WeatherDisplay.jsx`) and supported by backend endpoints (see `routes/weather_routes.py` and `routes/recommendations_routes.py`).

## Prerequisites

- **Repository**: Ensure you have cloned the repository and are in the root `ayurveda` directory before proceeding.
- **Node.js and npm**: Ensure you have Node.js (v14 or higher) and npm installed.
- **Python**: Python 3.8+ is required.
- **Package Manager**: Use `pip` (or conda if preferred) to manage Python dependencies.

## Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**

   Ensure you are in the `ayurveda` directory, then navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd back
   ```
   All backend commands should be run from within the back directory.
   
   > Note: It's recommended to open a dedicated terminal window for running the backend server.

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**
   - Using conda:

     ```bash
     conda create -n herbbot python=3.8 -y
     conda activate herbbot
     ```
   - Or using venv:

     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Create a `.env` file in the back directory with the following content:

     ```ini
     PINECONE_API_KEY = "your_pinecone_api_key"
     OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_openai_api_key"
     SERP_API_KEY = "your_serp_api_key"
     WEATHER_API_KEY = "your_weather_api_key"  # Required for weather-based recommendations
     ```

5. **(Optional) Create Data Directory and Add PDF Files**
   - Create a Data directory in the backend folder and add your PDF files:

     ```bash
     mkdir -p Data
     # Copy your PDF files into the Data directory
     ```

6. **(Optional) Build the Knowledge Base**
   - If required for the new feature, run:

     ```bash
     python store_index.py
     ```

6. **Start the Backend Server**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   - The Flask backend should now be running on http://localhost:8080.

## Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**

   Open another terminal window for the frontend commands. Ensure you are in the `ayurveda` root directory, then:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
   All frontend commands should be run from within the frontend directory.

2. **Install Node Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the React Development Server**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   - The React app will typically open at http://localhost:3000.

## Verifying the New Feature

- **Ensure Both Services are Running**:
  - Verify that the backend is running on http://localhost:8080
  - Verify that the frontend is running on http://localhost:3000
  - Both services must be running concurrently for the application to work properly

- **Access the React Application**:
  - Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.
- **Test the Weather Feature**:
  - Click on the 'Weather' tab in the navigation bar. Verify that the app displays current weather data along with Ayurvedic recommendations based on the fetched weather information.
  
- **API Testing**:
  - You can directly test the weather API endpoint: http://localhost:8080/api/weather?city=Mumbai&country=IN
  - Test weather-based recommendations: http://localhost:8080/api/recommendations?dosha=pitta&city=Mumbai&country=IN

## Troubleshooting

- **Terminal Setup**:
  - Ensure you have opened separate terminal windows for the backend and frontend.
  - Verify that each terminal is in the correct directory (`back` for backend, `frontend` for frontend).

- **Environment Variables**:
  - Confirm that the `.env` file exists in the `back` directory and contains all required API keys.
  - Ensure all API keys are valid and correctly formatted.

- **Data Directory**:
  - If using the knowledge base feature, verify that the `Data` directory exists in the `back` directory and contains the necessary PDF files.

- **General Issues**:
  - If issues with dependencies or API errors occur, confirm all prerequisites are installed and API keys in the `.env` file are correct.
  - Check the console logs for error messages and address them accordingly.
  - For weather-related features, ensure your WEATHER_API_KEY is valid and that you're providing valid city names in your requests.
  - If the weather feature isn't working, verify network connectivity as the application needs to make external API calls.

## Testing Setup and Execution

The project includes comprehensive test suites for both backend and frontend components. Follow these instructions to set up and run the tests.

### Backend Testing

1. **Install Testing Dependencies**

   Navigate to the backend directory and install pytest and related packages:
   ```bash
   cd back
   pip install pytest pytest-cov pytest-mock
   ```

2. **Run Backend Tests**

   From the backend directory, execute:
   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   pytest

   # Run tests with coverage report
   pytest --cov=.

   # Run specific test modules
   pytest tests/test_dosha.py
   pytest tests/test_weather.py
   pytest tests/test_recommendations.py
   ```

3. **Test Structure**
   - Backend tests are located in the `tests/backend` directory
   - Tests are organized by feature (dosha, weather, recommendations, general_chat)

### Frontend Testing

1. **Install Testing Dependencies**

   The required testing packages are already included in the package.json devDependencies:
   - @testing-library/jest-dom
   - @testing-library/react
   - @testing-library/user-event

2. **Run Frontend Tests**

   From the frontend directory, execute:
   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   npm test

   # Run tests with coverage report
   npm test -- --coverage

   # Run specific test files
   npm test -- DoshaQuiz.test.js
   npm test -- WeatherDisplay.test.js
   ```

3. **Test Structure**
   - Frontend tests are located in the `tests/frontend` directory
   - Each React component has a corresponding test file (e.g., DoshaQuiz.jsx â†’ DoshaQuiz.test.js)

### End-to-End Testing (Optional)

1. **Install Cypress (if not already installed)**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install --save-dev cypress
   ```

2. **Run E2E Tests**
   ```bash
   # Open Cypress Test Runner
   npx cypress open

   # Run tests headlessly
   npx cypress run
   ```

3. **Test Structure**
   - E2E tests are located in the `tests/e2e` directory

## Additional Notes

- The weather feature integrates with the recommendations system to provide personalized Ayurvedic advice based on current weather conditions in your location.
- Weather data includes temperature, humidity, and general conditions which are mapped to Ayurvedic principles.
- The system can automatically determine the season based on weather data if not explicitly provided.
- When contributing new features, please ensure to add appropriate tests to maintain code quality.
