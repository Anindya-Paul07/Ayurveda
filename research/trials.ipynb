Herbs, which have always been the principal form \\nof medicine in developing countries, have again become popular in the developed world,  \\nas people strive to stay healthy in the face of chronic stress and pollution, and to treat illness \\nwith medicines that work in concert with the body’s defenses. A quiet revolution has been \\ntaking place. Tens of millions of people now take herbs such as ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba, p. 100)  \\nto help maintain mental and physical health, and increasingly people consult trained herbal \\nprofessionals and naturopaths for chronic or routine health problems. Increasingly too, \\nscientific evidence is accumulating to show that herbal medicines can provide treatment that  \\nis as effective as conventional medicines but with few side effects. Sales of herbal medicines \\ncontinue to grow year after year—by over 50 percent in the U.S. since 2000—and several \\nmainstream pharmaceutical companies now manufacture and market herbal medicines. \\nPlant Medicines\\nThe variety and sheer number of plants with therapeutic properties are quite astonishing. \\nSome 50,000 to 70,000 plant species, from lichens to towering trees, have been used at  \\none time or another for medicinal purposes. Today, Western herbal medicine still makes use  \\nof hundreds of native European plants, as well as many hundreds of species from other \\ncontinents. In Ayurveda (traditional Indian medicine) about 2,000 plant species are \\nconsidered to have medicinal value, while the Chinese Pharmacopoeia lists over 5,700 \\ntraditional medicines, mostly of plant origin. \\n About 500 herbs are still employed within conventional medicine, although whole plants are \\nrarely used. In general, the herbs provide the starting material for the isolation or synthesis  \\nof conventional drugs. Digoxin, for example, which is used for heart failure, was isolated \\nfrom common foxglove (Digitalis purpurea, p. 202), and the contraceptive pill was \\nsynthesized from constituents found in wild yam (Dioscorea villosa, p. 91).\\nEcological Factors\\nThe increased use of medicinal herbs has important environmental implications. Growing \\nherbs as an organic crop offers new opportunities for farmers, and sometimes, especially  \\nin developing countries, opportunities for whole communities. In northeastern Brazil,  \\nfor example, community-run herb gardens grow medicinal herbs that are sold to local hospitals. \\nDoctors at the hospital then prescribe these medicines for their patients.\\n The rise in popularity of herbal medicines, however, also directly threatens the survival  \\nof some wild species. Demand for goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis, p. 105) has become so  \\ngreat that it now fetches around $140 a pound (£170 a kilo). It was a common plant in the \\nwoodlands of northern America two centuries ago, but is now an endangered species, with \\nits survival in the wild threatened by overcollection. This example is by no means unique, \\nand, sadly, many species are similarly threatened across the planet. The extinction of plant \\nspecies as a result of over-intensive collecting is nothing new. The herb silphion, a member  \\nof the carrot family, was used extensively as a contraceptive by the women of ancient Rome. \\nUS_006-007_Introduction.indd   6 26/02/16   4:42 pm'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\Encyclopedia Of Herbal Medicine_2.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='7\\nSilphion proved difficult to cultivate and was gathered from the wild in such large quantities \\nthat it became extinct during the 3rd century ce.\\n Today, if herbal medicine continues to grow at its present rate, it is imperative that \\nmanufacturers, suppliers, practitioners, and the public use only produce that has been \\ncultivated or wildcrafted in an ecologically sensitive manner. \\nAbout This Book\\nIn the past, books on herbal medicine have tended to focus either on the traditional and \\nfolkloric use of plants or on their active constituents and pharmacology. The Encyclopedia  \\nof Herbal Medicine , which features over 550 plants, aims to cover both aspects. It discusses \\neach plant’s history, traditions, and folklore, and explains in simple terms what is known from \\nscientific research about its active constituents, actions, and potential new uses.\\n It is easy when concentrating on the scientific aspect of herbal medicine to forget that \\nmuch, in some cases all, that we currently know about a particular plant results from its \\ntraditional use. Moreover, even when a plant has been well researched, herbal medicines are \\nso complex and variable that what is currently known is rarely definitive, but rather a sound \\npointer as to how it works. Sometimes the traditional use, insofar as it is based on the \\nexperience of practitioners, provides an insight into how best to use an herb that is missing \\nfrom scientific knowledge alone. Herbal medicine is, after all, both a science and an art. \\n In choosing the plants profiled in the Encyclopedia, the aim has been to select herbs that are \\ncommonly used in different parts of the world and are considered to have particular health \\nbenefits. The index of key medicinal plants (pp. 54–155) contains many herbs that are \\nreadily available in health stores and pharmacies, for example St. John’s wort ( Hypericum \\nperforatum, p. 106). It also includes herbs that are more commonly known as foods, such as \\nlemon (Citrus limon, p. 82), but which, nonetheless, are valuable medicines. The index of other \\nmedicinal plants (pp. 156–283) contains some less commonly known but important medicinal \\nherbs, such as andrographis (Andrographis paniculata, p. 167), a traditional Indian medicinal \\nplant that stimulates recovery from infection and supports normal liver function. \\n A global overview of the history of herbal medicine puts the development of different \\nherbal traditions from earliest origins to the present day into perspective. This is complemented \\nwith features on herbal medicine in Europe, India, China, Africa, Australia, and the Americas, \\nproviding a rounded picture of herbal medicine worldwide.\\n Herbal medicine is nothing if not practical in its approach, and the Encyclopedia  has a \\ndetailed self-help section with advice on preparing and using herbal medicines to treat  \\na range of common health problems.\\n If more people come to appreciate the immense richness of the world of herbal  \\nmedicine and are able to benefit from the curative properties of medicinal herbs, this  \\nbook will have achieved its aim.\\nUS_006-007_Introduction.indd   7 07/04/16   4:36 pm\\n'),\n",

They are used  \\nboth in herbal and conventional medicine and offer benefits that pharmaceutical drugs  \\noften lack, helping to combat illness and support the body’s efforts to regain good health.\\nThere is no doubt that in extreme situations, the treatments \\ndevised by modern medicine can offer an unparalleled \\nopportunity to relieve symptoms and save lives. A newspaper \\narticle in 1993 described the terrible conditions in a hospital \\nin war-torn Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina. \\nDeprived of conventional medical supplies and drugs, the \\ndoctors were forced to use a well-known European herb, \\nvalerian (Valeriana officinalis, p. 148), as a painkiller for the \\nwounded and as an anesthetic. Valerian is an effective herbal \\nmedicine for anxiety and nervous tension, but it is woefully \\ninadequate as an analgesic or anesthetic.\\n Orthodox pharmaceutical medicines sustain life and counter \\ninfections in situations where other types of treatment  \\nmay have little to offer. Modern surgical techniques, such as \\nkeyhole surgery and plastic surgery, and the whole range of \\ndiagnostics and of life-support machinery now available, can  \\nall be used to improve the chances of recovery from serious \\nillness or injury. \\nThe Benefits of Herbal Medicine\\nY et despite the dramatic advances and advantages of \\nconventional medicine, or biomedicine as it is also known,  \\nit is clear that herbal medicine has much to offer. We tend  \\nto forget that in all but the past 70 years or so, humans  \\nhave relied almost entirely on plants to treat all manner  \\nof illnesses, from minor problems such as coughs and colds  \\nto life-threatening diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria. \\nToday, herbal remedies are coming back into prominence \\nbecause the efficacy of conventional medicines such as \\nantibiotics, which once had near-universal effectiveness against \\nserious infections, is on the wane. Over the years, infectious \\norganisms have developed resistance to synthesized drugs, \\nand the herb sweet wormwood (Artemisia annua, p. 67) and  \\nits active constituent artemisinin, for example, are now the \\nstandard treatment for malaria in tropical areas where  \\nthe protozoa causing the infection no longer respond to \\nconventional treatment.\\n Herbal medicine often complements conventional \\ntreatments, providing safe, well-tolerated remedies for chronic \\nillnesses. It is experiencing a dramatic renaissance in Western \\ncountries, partly because no effective conventional treatment \\nas yet exists for many chronic illnesses, such as asthma, \\narthritis, and irritable bowel syndrome. In addition, concern \\nover the side effects of biomedicine is encouraging people  \\nto look for more gentle forms of treatment. It is estimated \\nthat 10–20% of hospital patients in the West are there due \\nto the side effects of conventional medical treatment.\\nUsing Herbs Wisely\\nMost commonly used herbs are extremely safe to use.  \\nBut some plants can produce side effects and, like all \\nmedicines, herbal remedies must be treated with respect.  \\nIt is essential to take or use certain plants only under the \\nguidance of a well-trained practitioner, to avoid adverse \\nconsequences. Ma huang (Ephedra sinica, p. 95), for example, \\ncan be extremely toxic at the wrong dosage, and comfrey \\n(Symphytum officinale, p. 138), a very popular herb in the \\npast, is thought to cause severe or even fatal liver damage  \\nin rare circumstances. When an herbal medicine is used \\ncorrectly, however, the chances of developing a serious side \\neffect are remote.\\nPotent Plant Chemicals\\nThe ability of an herbal medicine to affect body systems \\ndepends on the chemical constituents that it contains. \\nScientists first started extracting and isolating chemicals from \\nplants in the 18th century, and since that time we have \\ngrown accustomed to looking at herbs and their effects in \\nterms of the active constituents they contain. This Encyclopedia \\nis no exception, providing details of all the main active \\nconstituents of the medicinal herbs featured and explaining \\ntheir actions.\\nOpium poppy fields in Tasmania. Opium, derived from the seed capsules of the opium \\npoppy, yields the narcotic alkaloids morphine and codeine, powerful painkillers that are \\nwidely used in conventional medicine.\\nUS_010-013_How_Medicinal_Plants_work.indd   10 26/02/16   4:42 pm'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\Encyclopedia Of Herbal Medicine_2.pdf', 'page': 12}, page_content='11 How Medicinal Plants work\\nResearch into isolated plant \\nconstituents is of great \\nimportance, for it has given rise \\nto many of the world’s most \\nuseful drugs. Tubocurarine, the \\nmost powerful muscle relaxant \\nin existence, is derived from \\npareira (Chondrodendron \\ntomentosum, p. 189), and the \\nstrongest painkiller of all, \\nmorphine, comes from opium \\npoppy (Papaver somniferum ,  \\np. 244). Many anesthetics  \\nare also derived from plants—\\nfor example cocaine comes \\nfrom coca (Erythroxylum  \\ncoca, p. 206).\\n Today, biomedicine still  \\nrelies on plants rather than  \\nthe laboratory for at least 25%  \\nof its medicines, and many of \\nthese are among the most effective of all conventional drugs.  \\nIt is hard to think of a world deprived of the antimalarial \\nproperties of quinine (derived from Cinchona spp., p. 80); or \\nthe heart remedy digoxin (from Digitalis spp., p. 202); or the \\ncough-relieving properties of ephedrine (from Ephedra sinica, \\np. 95), which is present in many prescription and over-the-\\ncounter cold remedies. These and many other conventional \\nmedicines are all derived from isolated plant constituents.\\nValue of Whole Plants\\nAlthough it is important to understand the actions of \\nindividual active constituents, herbal medicine, unlike bio-\\nmedicine, is ultimately about the use and actions of whole \\nplants—medicines that are literally god- or goddess-given, \\nrather than developed in a laboratory. In the same way that \\ntaking a watch apart and identifying its key parts will not show \\nyou how it works as a whole, dividing up a medicinal herb \\ninto its constituent parts cannot explain exactly how it works \\nin its natural form. The whole herb is worth more than the \\nsum of its parts, and scientific research is increasingly showing \\nthat the active constituents of many herbs, for example those \\nin ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba, p. 100), interact in complex ways to \\nproduce the therapeutic effect of the remedy as a whole.\\n Plants contain hundreds, if not thousands, of different \\nconstituent chemicals that interact in complex ways. \\nFrequently, we simply do not know in detail how a particular \\nherb works—even though its medicinal benefit is well \\nestablished. The pharmacological approach to understanding \\nhow whole herbs work is like working on a puzzle where only \\nsome of the pieces have been provided. Furthermore, \\nalthough it is very useful to know that a plant contains certain \\nactive constituents, such information can be misleading on its \\nown. For example, Chinese rhubarb ( Rheum palmatum,  \\np. 126) is a commonly used laxative, containing \\nanthraquinones that irritate the gut wall and stimulate bowel \\nmovement. This laxative effect, however, occurs only when \\nlarge quantities of the herb are used. At lower doses other \\nconstituents, notably tannins, which dry and tighten up \\nmucous membranes in the gut, have greater effect. As a \\nresult, Chinese rhubarb works in two apparently opposite \\nways depending on the dosage: as a laxative at moderate to \\nhigh doses; to treat diarrhea at a lower dose.\\n This example reveals a couple of fundamental truths  \\nabout herbal medicine. Firstly, the experience of the herbal \\npractitioner and of the patient often provide the most \\nreliable guide to the medicinal effect of individual herbs. \\nSecondly, the value of a medicinal herb cannot be reduced \\nsimply to a list of its active constituents.\\nPlants as Foods & Medicines\\nIn general, the human body is much better suited to \\ntreatment with herbal remedies than with isolated chemical \\nmedicines. We have evolved side-by-side with plants over \\nhundreds of thousands of years, and our digestive system \\nand physiology as a whole are geared to digesting and \\nutilizing plant-based foods, which often have a medicinal \\nvalue as well as providing sustenance.\\n The dividing line between “foods” and “medicines” may  \\nnot always be clear. Are lemons, papayas, onions, and oats \\nfoods or medicines? The answer, very simply, is that they  \\nare both. Lemon (Citrus limon, p. 82) improves resistance  \\nto infection; papaya (Carica papaya, p. 183) is taken in some \\nparts of the world to expel worms; onion ( Allium cepa,  \\np. 164) relieves bronchial infections; and oats (Avena sativa,  \\np. 175) support convalescence. Indeed, herbal medicine \\ncomes into its own when the distinctions between foods  \\nand medicines are removed. \\nCultivation of medicinal plants in Cameroon.

There are many thousands  \\nof medicinal plants in use throughout the world, with a \\ntremendous range of actions and degrees of potency. Most \\nhave a specific action on particular body systems and are \\nknown to be suitable for treating certain types of ailments. \\nSee p. 13 for specific actions.\\nDigestion, Respiration, & Circulation\\nImproving the quality of the diet is often an essential starting \\npoint in sustaining or regaining good health. The saying “Y ou \\nare what you eat” is by and large true, though herbalists \\nprefer to qualify it, saying “Y ou are what you absorb from \\nwhat you eat.” Herbal medicines not only provide nutrients, \\nbut when needed they also strengthen and support the \\naction of the digestive system, speeding up the rate of \\nprocessing food and improving the absorption of nutrients.\\n The body requires another kind of “nutrient” to  \\nfunction—oxygen. The lungs and respiratory system can  \\nbe helped with herbs that relax the bronchial muscles and \\nstimulate respiration.\\n Once taken in by the body, nutrients and medicines are \\ncarried to the body’s estimated one hundred trillion cells.  \\nThe circulatory system has a remarkable ability to adapt  \\nto an endlessly shifting pattern of demand. At rest, the flow  \\nof blood is mainly toward the center of the body, while \\nwhen active, the muscles in the limbs make huge demands. \\nHerbal medicines work to encourage circulation in \\nparticular ways. Some, for example, encourage blood to  \\nflow to the surface of the body; others stimulate the heart  \\nto pump more efficiently; while others relax the muscles of \\nthe arteries, lowering blood pressure.\\nClearing Toxicity & Soothing Skin\\nAfter circulation has carried nutrients to the cells, waste \\nmatter must be removed. All too often in our polluted world, \\nhigh levels of toxicity in the body are an underlying cause of  \\nill health, and herbalists use a wide range of cleansing herbs \\nthat improve the body’s ability to remove toxins. Perhaps  \\nthe finest example of a detoxifying herb is burdock (Arctium \\nlappa, p. 65), which is used extensively in both Western and \\nChinese medicine. Once herbs such as this reduce the toxic \\n“load,” the body is able to invest greater resources  \\nin repairing and strengthening damaged tissue and  \\nweakened organs.\\n The skin also plays an important role in good health. \\nAntiseptic plants fight infection, while vulnerary (wound-\\nhealing) herbs such as comfrey (Symphytum officinale,  \\np. 138) encourage blood clotting and help speed the healing  \\nof wounds.\\nNervous, Endocrine, & Immune Systems \\nGood health depends on having a healthy, balanced nervous \\nsystem. In order to ensure long-term good health of the \\nnervous system, it is important to adapt well to life’s daily \\ndemands, to avoid excessive anxiety, worry, or depression, \\nand to get sufficient rest and exercise.\\n The latest research shows that the nervous system does \\nnot work in isolation but is complemented by the endocrine \\nsystem, which controls the release of a whole symphony  \\nof hormones, including the sex hormones, which control \\nfertility and often affect vitality and mood. The nervous \\nsystem is also intimately linked with the immune system, \\nwhich controls the ability to resist infection and to recover \\nfrom illness and injury.\\n This incredible complex of systems—part electrical, part \\nchemical, part mechanical—must function harmoniously if \\ngood health is to be maintained. In health, the body has a \\nseemingly infinite capacity, via its controlling systems, to adjust \\nand change to external pressures. This ability to adapt to the \\nexternal world while the body’s internal workings remain \\nconstant is known as homeostasis. Many herbs work with  \\nthe immune, nervous, and endocrine systems to help the \\nbody adapt more effectively to stresses and strains of all kinds: \\nphysical, mental, emotional, and even spiritual. They are \\neffective because they work in tune with the body’s processes.\\n Some herbs are adaptogenic, meaning that they have an \\nability to help people to adapt, either by supporting the \\nnervous system and easing nervous and emotional tension,  \\nor by working directly with the body’s own physiological \\nprocesses to maintain health. The prime example of an \\nadaptogenic herb is ginseng (Panax ginseng, p. 118), which  \\nis an effective remedy at times of great mental or physical \\nstress, but in certain cases can also be taken when a relaxing \\neffect is required, for example to relieve headaches, or to \\nensure a good night’s sleep.\\nComplex Natural Medicines\\nAs can be seen, an herb is not a “magic bullet” with a single \\naction, but a complex natural medicine composed of many \\nactive constituents that work on different body systems. By \\ncombining scientific research into active constituents with \\nclinical observation and traditional knowledge of the whole \\nplant, we can develop a rounded picture of each herb’s range \\nof medicinal uses.\\nUS_010-013_How_Medicinal_Plants_work.indd   12 26/02/16   4:42 pm'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\Encyclopedia Of Herbal Medicine_2.pdf', 'page': 15}, page_content='14\\nThe developmen T  of herbal medicine\\nPhenols\\nPhenols are a very varied group  \\nof plant constituents ranging from \\nsalicylic acid, a molecule similar  \\nto aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), to \\ncomplex sugar-containing phenolic \\nglycosides. Phenols are often anti-\\ninflammatory and antiseptic, and  \\nare thought to be produced by \\nplants to protect against infection  \\nand feeding by insects. Phenolic \\nacids, such as rosmarinic acid,  \\nare strongly antioxidant and anti-\\ninflammatory, and can also have \\nantiviral properties. Wintergreen \\n(Gaultheria procumbens, p. 215)  \\nand white willow (Salix alba, p. 129) \\nboth contain salicylates. Many mint \\nfamily members contain phenols—\\nfor example, the strongly antiseptic \\nthymol, found in thyme (Thymus \\nvulgaris, p. 143). \\nVolatile Oils\\nVolatile oils—which are extracted  \\nfrom plants to produce \\nessential oils—are some  \\nof the most important \\nmedicinally active plant \\nconstituents, and are  \\nalso used widely in \\nperfumery. They are \\ncomplex mixtures often of \\n100 or more compounds, \\nmostly made up of \\nmonoterpenes—molecules \\ncontaining 10 carbon atoms. \\nEssential oils have many uses. \\nTea tree oil (Melaleuca alternifolia, \\np. 112) is strongly antiseptic, while \\nsweet gale oil (Myrica gale, p. 238) is an \\neffective insect repellent. On distillation, some \\nessential oils contain compounds not found in \\nthe volatile oil—chamazulene, found in German \\nchamomile (Chamomilla recutita, p. 77) essential \\noil, is anti-inflammatory and antiallergenic.  \\nResins—sticky oily substances that seep from \\nplants, for example from the bark of Scots  \\npine (Pinus sylvestris, p. 249)—are often  \\nlinked with essential oils (oleoresins) and  \\ngums (see Polysaccharides), though they  \\nare nonvolatile. \\nActive Constituents\\nThe medicinal effects of certain plants are well known. German chamomile, for example, has been \\ntaken to soothe digestive problems for thousands of years, and aloe vera was known to Cleopatra as  \\na healing skin remedy. It is only relatively recently, however, that active constituents responsible for the \\nmedicinal actions of plants have been isolated and observed. Knowing a little about the chemicals \\ncontained in plants helps you to understand how they work within the body.\\nFlavonoids\\nFound widely throughout \\nthe plant world, flavonoids \\nare polyphenolic \\ncompounds that act  \\nas pigments, imparting \\ncolor, often yellow or \\nwhite, to flowers and \\nfruits. They have a wide \\nrange of actions and many \\nmedicinal uses. They are \\nantioxidant and especially \\nuseful in maintaining healthy \\ncirculation. Some flavonoids also \\nhave anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and \\nliver-protective activity. Flavonoids such as hesperidin and rutin, \\nfound in many plants, notably buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum,  \\np. 210) and lemon (Citrus limon, p. 82), strengthen capillaries  \\nand prevent leakage into surrounding tissues. Isoflavones,  \\nfound for example in red clover (Trifolium pratense,  \\np. 277), are estrogenic and valuable in treating  \\nmenopausal symptoms.\\nTannins\\nT annins are produced to a greater or \\nlesser degree by all plants. The harsh, \\nastringent taste of tannin-laden bark \\nand leaves makes them unpalatable to \\ninsects and grazing animals. T annins are \\npolyphenolic compounds that contract and astringe tissues of the body by \\nbinding with and precipitating proteins—hence their use to “tan” leather. \\nThey also help to stop bleeding and to check infection. T annin-containing \\nherbs are used to tighten up over-relaxed tissues—as in varicose veins—\\nto dry up excessive watery secretions—as in diarrhea—and to protect \\ndamaged tissue—such as skin problems resulting from eczema or a burn. \\nOak bark (Quercus robur, p. 260) and black catechu (Acacia catechu, p. 158) \\nare both high in tannins.\\nBlack Catechu\\n(Acacia catechu)\\nThyme\\n(Thymus vulgaris)\\nLemon\\n(Citrus limon)\\nGerman Chamomile\\n(Chamomilla recutita)\\nUS_014-017_Active_Constituents.indd   14 26/02/16   4:42 pm'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\Encyclopedia Of Herbal Medicine_2.pdf', 'page': 16}, page_content='15 Active constituentsProanthocyanins\\nClosely related to tannins and flavonoids, \\nthese polyphenolic compounds are \\npigments that give flowers and \\nfruits a blue, purple, or red hue. \\nThey are powerfully antioxidant \\nand free-radical scavengers. They \\nprotect the circulation from damage, \\nespecially the circulation in the \\nheart, hands, feet, and eyes. \\nBlackberry (Rubus fruticosus, \\np. 264), red grapes (Vitis \\nvinifera, p. 283), and \\nhawthorn (Crataegus \\noxycantha, p. 87) all contain \\nappreciable quantities of \\nthese proanthocyanins.\\nCoumarins\\nCoumarins of different kinds are found  \\nin many plant species and have widely \\ndivergent actions. The coumarins in melilot \\n(Melilotus officinalis , p. 234) and horse \\nchestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum, p. 58)  \\nhelp to keep the blood thin, while \\nfuranocoumarins such as bergapten,  \\nfound in celery ( Apium graveolens , p. 64), \\nstimulate skin tanning, and khellin, found  \\nin visnaga ( Ammi visnaga, p. 62), is a \\npowerful smooth-muscle relaxant.\\nSaponins\\nThe main active \\nconstituents in many \\nkey medicinal plants, \\nsaponins gained their \\nname because, like soap, \\nthey make a lather when \\nplaced in water. Saponins occur in two \\ndifferent forms—steroidal and triterpenoid. \\nThe chemical structure of steroidal saponins \\nis similar to that of many of the body’s hormones, for example \\nestrogen and cortisol, and many plants containing them have a \\nmarked hormonal activity. Wild yam ( Dioscorea villosa , p. 91), from  \\nwhich the contraceptive pill was first developed, contains steroidal \\nsaponins. Triterpenoid saponins occur more commonly—for example  \\nin licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra, p. 101) and cowslip root (Primula veris,  \\np. 256)—but have less hormonal activity. They are often expectorant  \\nand aid absorption of nutrients.\\nAnthraquinones\\nAnthraquinones are the main active \\nconstituents in herbs such as senna \\n(Cassia senna, p. 75) and Chinese rhubarb \\n(Rheum palmatum, p. 126), both of which \\nare taken to relieve constipation. \\nAnthraquinones have an irritant laxative \\neffect on the large intestine, causing \\ncontractions of the intestinal walls \\nand stimulating a bowel \\nmovement approximately 10 \\nhours after being taken. They \\nalso make the stool more liquid, \\neasing bowel movements.\\nCyanogenic glycosides\\nThough these glycosides are \\nbased on cyanide, a very \\npotent poison, in small \\ndoses they have a \\nhelpful sedative and \\nrelaxant effect  \\non the heart and \\nmuscles. The bark  \\nof wild cherry ( Prunus \\nserotina, p. 257) and the \\nleaves of elder (Sambucus nigra,  \\np. 132) both contain cyanogenic \\nglycosides, which contribute to the plant’s \\nability to suppress and soothe irritant dry \\ncoughs. Many fruit kernels contain high \\nlevels of cyanogenic glycosides, for example \\nthose of apricot (Prunus armeniaca, p. 257).\\nCardiac Glycosides\\nFound in various medicinal plants, notably  \\nin foxgloves (see common foxglove, Digitalis \\npurpurea, p. 202) and in lily of the valley \\n(Convallaria majalis, p. 194), cardiac glycosides \\nsuch as digitoxin, digoxin, and convallotoxin \\nhave a strong, direct action on the heart, \\nsupporting its strength and rate of \\ncontraction when it is failing. Cardiac \\nglycosides are also significantly diuretic. \\nThey help to stimulate urine production, \\nthus increasing the removal of fluid from \\nthe tissues and circulatory system.\\nCelery\\n(Apium graveolens)\\nChinese Rhubarb\\n(Rheum palmatum)\\nBlackberry\\n(Rubus fruticosus)\\nLicorice\\n(Glycyrrhiza \\nglabra)\\nCommon Foxglove\\n(Digitalis purpurea)\\nElderflower\\n(Sambucus nigra)\\nUS_014-017_Active_Constituents.indd   15 26/02/16   4:42 pm\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\Encyclopedia Of Herbal Medicine_2.pdf', 'page': 17}, page_content='16\\nThe developmen T  of herbal medicine\\nPolysaccharides\\nFound in all plants, polysaccharides \\nare multiple units of sugar \\nmolecules linked together. From  \\nan herbal point of view, the most \\nimportant polysaccharides are the \\n“sticky” mucilages and gums, which \\nare commonly found in roots, bark, \\nleaves, and seeds. Both mucilage and \\ngum soak up large quantities of water, \\nproducing a sticky, jelly-like mass that can be \\nused to soothe and protect irritated tissue, for \\nexample, dry irritated skin and sore or inflamed mucous membranes  \\nin the gut. Mucilaginous herbs, such as slippery elm (Ulmus rubra, p. 145) \\nand linseed or flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum, p. 109), are best prepared  \\nby soaking (macerating) in plenty of cold water. Some polysaccharides \\nstimulate the immune system, for example acemannan, which is found  \\nin the leaves of aloe vera (Aloe vera, p. 60).\\nAlkaloids\\nA very mixed group, alkaloids mostly \\ncontain a nitrogen-bearing molecule  \\n(-NH2) that makes them particularly \\npharmacologically active. Some are \\nwell-known drugs and have a \\nrecognized medical use. Vincristine, \\nfor example, derived from Madagascar \\nperiwinkle (Vinca rosea, p. 282), is used \\nto treat some types of cancer. \\nOther alkaloids, such as \\natropine, found in deadly \\nnightshade (Atropa belladonna,  \\np. 69), have a direct effect on the \\nbody, reducing spasms, relieving pain,  \\nand drying up bodily secretions.\\nVitamins\\nThough often overlooked, many \\nmedicinal plants contain useful \\nlevels of vitamins. Some are well \\nknown for their vitamin content, \\nfor example dog rose (Rosa \\ncanina, p. 263) has high levels of \\nvitamin C, and carrot (Daucus \\ncarota, p. 201) is rich in beta-\\ncarotene (pro-vitamin A), but \\nmany are less well recognized. \\nWatercress (Nasturtium \\nofficinale, p. 239), for \\nexample, contains \\nappreciable levels of \\nvitamins B1, B2, C, and E as well \\nas beta-carotene, while sea \\nbuckthorn (Hippophae \\nrhamnoides, p. 220) can be \\nregarded as a vitamin and \\nmineral supplement in its  \\nown right.\\nGlucosilinates\\nFound exclusively in species of  \\nthe mustard and cabbage family, \\nglucosilinates have an irritant effect  \\non the skin, causing inflammation \\nand blistering. Applied as poultices \\nto painful or aching joints, \\nthey increase blood flow to \\nthe affected area, helping to \\nremove the buildup of waste \\nproducts (a contributory factor in \\nmany joint problems). On eating, \\nglucosilinates are broken down and \\nproduce a strong, pungent taste. \\nRadish (Raphanus sativus, p. 261)  \\nand watercress (Nasturtium officinale,  \\np. 239) are typical glucosilinate-\\ncontaining plants. \\nBitters\\nBitters are a varied group of constituents \\nlinked only by their pronounced bitter taste. \\nThe bitterness itself stimulates secretions  \\nby the salivary glands and digestive organs. \\nSuch secretions can dramatically improve the \\nappetite and strengthen the overall function  \\nof the digestive system. With the improved \\ndigestion and absorption of nutrients that follow, \\nthe body is nourished and strengthened. Many  \\nherbs have bitter constituents, notably \\nwormwood (Artemisia absinthium, p. 66),  \\nchiretta (Swertia chirata, p. 273), and hops \\n(Humulus lupulus, p. 104). \\nMinerals\\nLike vegetable foods, many medicinal \\nplants provide high levels of minerals. \\nPlants, especially organically grown  \\nones, draw minerals from the soil and \\nconvert them into a form that is more \\neasily absorbed and used by the body. \\nWhether plants are eaten as a \\nvegetable, like cabbage (Brassica \\noleracea, p. 180), or taken as a medicine, \\nlike bladderwrack (Fucus vesiculosus,  \\np. 213), in many cases the mineral content \\nis a key factor in the plant’s therapeutic \\nactivity within the body. Dandelion leaf \\n(Taraxacum officinale, p. 141) is a potent \\ndiuretic, balanced by its high potassium  \\ncontent, while the high silica content of horsetail \\n(Equisetum arvense, p. 205) supports the repair \\nof connective tissue, making it useful in arthritis. \\nSlippery Elm\\n(Ulmus rubra)\\nDeadly Nightshade\\n(Atropa belladonna)\\nDog Rose\\n(Rosa canina)\\nDandelion\\n(Taraxacum officinale)\\nRadish\\n(Raphanus sativus)\\nWormwood\\n(Artemisia absinthium)\\nUS_014-017_Active_Constituents.indd   16 26/02/16   4:42 pm'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\Encyclopedia Of Herbal Medicine_2.pdf', 'page': 18}, page_content='17 quality control\\nCalendula\\nWhat should you look for when buying herbal medicines?  \\nIt is usually most convenient to buy capsules, tablets, \\nessential oils, pessaries, and perhaps tinctures, and to \\nmake up your own infusions, decoctions, and syrups  \\n(see p. 291 and p. 293). \\n• Buy from a reputable herb store, staffed by \\npeople knowledgeable about herbal medicines.\\n• Only buy herbs online from established  \\nherbal suppliers.\\n• Buy organic herbs and products where available.\\nBuying Dried Herbs\\nDried herbs are generally available from herbal suppliers. Buying  \\nfrom shops is preferable to buying online because the herbs can be \\nexamined before purchasing. However, it is possible some online \\ncompanies may supply fresher herbs due to higher turnover. To gain the \\nbest medicinal effect, good-quality produce is essential. Shop around \\nand bear in mind the following points before buying:\\n• Herbs should not be stored in clear glass jars or in direct sunlight,  \\nas this causes oxidation, which affects their efficacy.\\n• Good-quality aromatic herbs should have a distinct scent and taste.\\n• Check for signs of infestation due to poor drying techniques, or \\nadulteration. This can sometimes be recognized by the presence of  \\ndried grass or other non-medicinal material in the jar.\\n• Herbs lose their color as they age. Look for bright material that has \\nbeen well dried and stored, and that is not too old. Calendula flowers \\n(Calendula officinalis, p. 73) that are a vivid yellow/orange color are likely \\nto make good medicine. If they have been sitting on a shelf for  \\n18 months, they will probably look drab and pale.\\nBuying Herbal Products\\nWhen buying products such as capsules, tablets, essential oils, \\npessaries, and tinctures, always check the label on the jar or packet.  \\nIf it does not do the following, do not buy it:\\n■ Name all constituents of the product\\n■ State the recommended daily dosage\\n■ State the weight of each capsule or tablet, or volume of bottle\\n■ List the weight of each constituent of a capsule, tablet, etc. \\n■ List the ratio of herb in the product (for example, 1:3, meaning  \\n1 part herb to 3 parts liquid).\\nQuality is vital for herbal medicine. Without a guarantee that \\nthe correct herb of the right quality is being used, it is hard to \\nbe confident that the medicine will prove effective. In fact, one \\nreason why the medical profession has generally preferred \\nconventional medicines to herbal ones is the difficulty of \\nguaranteeing quality in herbal remedies. Many herbal products \\non the market are of high quality but some can be very poor.  \\nA 2006 U.S. study of black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa, p. 79) \\nfound that only 7 out of 11 over-the-counter products tested \\ncontained what was stated on the label. Four contained a \\ncheaper Chinese species instead. The adulteration of herbal \\nproducts, particularly in Chinese and Indian herbs sold in \\nthe West is, regrettably, not unusual. \\n Herb quality may be affected not only by deliberate \\nadulteration, but by the use of wrongly identified or poor-quality \\nmaterial. The herb may have been poorly harvested, dried, or \\nstored, or it may be old or decayed. It may even be that the \\nwrong herb was used. In each case, the lack of attention to \\nquality results in a product with reduced medicinal value—\\nor even none at all.\\n To try to ensure that only good-quality products are made, \\nmanufacturers of genuine herbal medicines use strict quality-\\ncontrol procedures. Usually this involves comparing the dried \\nherb material with listings in an herbal or national pharmacopeia \\n(a standard reference work that gives the characteristics one \\nwould expect to find when analyzing a specific herb). Quality \\ncontrol involves making routine checks to establish that the \\nherbal material is what it claims to be and that it meets a number \\nof minimum requirements. The material is inspected with the \\nnaked eye, and assessed microscopically, to see if its botanical \\nprofile matches the standard. Other checks are made to see \\nwhether it contains appropriate levels of active constituents \\nand to ensure that the material is free from contamination. \\n More sensitive quality-control methods, however, recognize \\nthat the quality of an herb does not depend simply on the \\npresence of one or two key active constituents. Increasingly, \\npeople in the world of herbal medicine are focusing on the \\n“fingerprint” of an herb—the unique chemical profile that \\nrepresents the complex pattern of constituents found when \\ngood-quality dried herb material is analyzed by sensitive \\nscientific machinery. By monitoring the sample and comparing \\nit with this unique fingerprint, it is possible to make a much \\nbroader assessment of quality than when using only one or \\ntwo constituents as a standard.\\nQuality control\\nMaking the most of herbal medicine means ensuring that herbs and herbal products  \\nused are of good quality—properly grown, well dried, correctly processed, and within  \\ntheir sell-by date. Using poor-quality herbal produce is all too often a waste of money \\nsince there is the strong possibility that you will receive little benefit from it.

Flaxseed \\n(Linum usitatissimum, p. 109), for example, provided its \\nharvesters with a nutritious food oil, fuel, a cosmetic balm  \\nfor the skin, and fiber to make fabric. At the same time it  \\nwas used to treat conditions such as bronchitis, respiratory \\ncongestion, boils, and a number of digestive problems. Given  \\nthe life-enhancing benefits that this and so many other plants \\nconferred, it is hardly surprising that most cultures believed \\nthem to have magical as well as medicinal abilities. It is \\nreasonable to assume that for tens of thousands of years \\nherbs were probably used as much for their ritual magical \\npowers as for their medicinal qualities. A 60,000-year-old \\nburial site excavated in Iraq, for instance, was found to \\ncontain eight different medicinal plants, including ephedra \\n(Ephedra sinica, p. 95). The inclusion of the plants in the  \\ntomb suggests they had supernatural significance as well  \\nas medicinal value.\\n In some cultures, plants were considered to have souls. \\nEven Aristotle, the 4th-century bce Greek philosopher, \\nthought that plants had a “psyche,” albeit of a lesser order \\nthan the human soul. In Hinduism, which dates back  \\nto at least 1500 bce, many plants are sacred to specific \\ndivinities. For example, the bael tree (Aegle marmelos,  \\np. 161) is said to shelter Shiva, the god of health, beneath  \\nits branches.\\n In medieval Europe, the Doctrine of Signatures stated \\nthere was a connection between how a plant looked—  \\nGod’s “signature”—and how it might be used medicinally.  \\nFor example, the mottled leaves of lungwort (Pulmonaria \\nofficinalis, p. 259) were thought to resemble lung tissue,  \\nand the plant is still used to treat ailments of the  \\nrespiratory tract.\\n Even in Western cultures, beliefs in plant spirits linger. Until \\nthe first half of the 20th century, British farm workers would \\nnot cut down elder trees (Sambucus nigra, p. 132) for fear of \\narousing the anger of the Elder Mother, the spirit who lived \\nin and protected the tree.\\n In a similar vein, native peoples of the Andes in South \\nAmerica believe that the coca plant (Erythroxylum coca,  \\np. 206) is protected by Mama Coca, a spirit who must be \\nrespected and placated if the leaves are to be harvested  \\nand used.\\nShamanistic Medicine\\nIn many traditional societies today, the world is believed to  \\nbe shaped by good and evil spirits. In these societies, illness  \\nis thought to stem from malignant forces or possession by  \\nevil spirits. If a member of the tribe falls ill, the shaman (the \\n“medicine” man or woman) is expected to intercede with \\nthe spirit world to bring about a cure. Shamans often enter \\nthe spiritual realm with the aid of hallucinogenic plants or \\nfungi, such as ayahuasca (Banisteriopsis caapi, p. 176), taken  \\nby Amazonian shamans, or fly agaric (Amanita muscaria), \\ntaken by traditional healers of the Siberian steppes. \\n At the same time, the shaman provides medical treatment \\nfor the physical needs of the patient—putting salves and \\ncompresses on wounds, boiling up decoctions and barks  \\nfor internal treatment, stimulating sweating for fevers, and so \\nMistletoe, which the Druids called “golden bough,” had a central place in their \\nshamanistic religious and healing ceremonies.

Such treatment is based on a wealth of acutely observed \\nplant lore and knowledge, handed down in an oral tradition \\nfrom generation to generation. \\nThe Development of Medicinal Lore\\nIt is generally recognized that our ancestors had a wide range \\nof medicinal plants at their disposal, and that they likewise \\npossessed a profound understanding of plants’ healing powers. \\nIn fact, up until the 20th century, every village and rural \\ncommunity had a wealth of herbal folklore. Tried and tested \\nlocal plants were picked for a range of common health \\nproblems and taken as teas, applied as lotions, or even mixed \\nwith lard and rubbed in as an ointment.\\n But what were the origins of this herbal expertise? There \\nare no definitive answers. Clearly, acute observation coupled \\nwith trial and error has played a predominant role. Human \\nsocieties have had many thousands of years to observe the \\neffects—both good and bad—of eating a particular root,  \\nleaf, or berry. Watching the behavior of animals after they \\nhave eaten or rubbed against certain plants has also added  \\nto medicinal lore. If one watches sheep or cattle, they almost \\nunerringly steer a path past poisonous plants such as ragwort \\n(Senecio jacobaea) or oleander (Nerium oleander). Over and \\nabove such close observation, some people have speculated \\nthat human beings, like grazing animals, have an instinct that \\nrecognizes poisonous as opposed to medicinal plants.\\nAncient Civilizations\\nAs civilizations grew from 3000 bce \\nonward in Egypt, the Middle East, \\nIndia, and China, so the use of \\nherbs became more sophisticated, \\nand the first written accounts of \\nmedicinal plants were made. The \\nEgyptian Ebers papyrus of c. 1500 \\nbce is the earliest surviving \\nexample. It lists dozens of \\nmedicinal plants, their uses, and \\nrelated spells and incantations. The \\nherbs include myrrh (Commiphora molmol, p. 85), castor oil  \\n(Ricinus communis, p. 262), and garlic (Allium sativum, p. 59).\\n In India, the Vedas, epic poems written c. 1500 bce, also \\ncontain rich material on the herbal lore of that time. The \\nVedas were followed in about 400 bce by the Charaka Samhita, \\nwritten by the physician Charaka. This medical treatise \\nincludes details of around 350 herbal medicines. Among \\nthem are visnaga (Ammi visnaga, p. 62), an herb of Middle \\nEastern origin that has recently proven effective in the \\ntreatment of asthma, and gotu kola (Centella asiatica, p. 76), \\nwhich has long been used to treat leprosy.\\nMedicine Breaks from its  \\nMystical Origins\\nBy about 500 bce in developed \\ncultures, medicine began to separate \\nfrom the magical and spiritual \\nworld. Hippocrates (460–377 bce), \\nthe Greek “father of medicine,” \\nconsidered illness to be a natural \\nrather than a supernatural \\nphenomenon, and he felt that \\nmedicine should be given without \\nritual ceremonies or magic.\\n In the earliest Chinese medical  \\ntext, the Yellow Emperor’s Classic of \\nInternal Medicine written in the 1st \\ncentury bce, the emphasis on rational \\nmedicine is equally clear: “In treating \\nillness, it is necessary to examine  \\nthe entire context, scrutinize the \\nShiva, the Hindu god who oversees health, is traditionally thought to live under the bael tree, \\nan important medicinal plant in India.\\nThe bump in the right cheek of this \\nPeruvian figurine may represent \\ncoca, taken in that country to \\nincrease endurance.\\nCastor oil plant \\nhas been used \\nmedicinally for \\nabout 4000 years.\\nUS_018-027_Early_Origins_To_The_19_Century.indd   19 26/02/16   4:42 pm\\n'),\n",

As the \\ncenturies passed, the popularity of cloves grew, and by the \\n8th century ce, their strong aromatic flavor and powerfully \\nantiseptic and analgesic properties were familiar throughout \\nmost of Europe.\\n As trade and interest in \\nherbal medicines and spices \\nflourished, various writers \\ntried to make systematic \\nrecords of plants with a \\nknown medicinal action and \\nrecord their properties.\\n In China, the Divine \\nHusbandman’s Classic  \\n(Shen’nong Bencaojing), \\nwritten in the 1st century ce, \\nhas 364 entries, of which 252 \\nare herbal medicines, including \\nbupleurum (Bupleurum \\nchinense, p. 72), coltsfoot \\n(Tussilago farfara,  \\np. 278), and gan cao (Glycyrrhiza uralensis). This Daoist text  \\nlaid the foundations for the continuous development  \\nand refinement of Chinese herbal medicine up to the  \\npresent day.\\n In Europe, a 1st-century ce Greek physician named \\nDioscorides wrote the first European herbal, De Materia \\nMedica. His intention was to produce an accurate and \\nauthoritative work on herbal medicines, and in this he was \\ndramatically successful. Among the many plants mentioned \\nare juniper (Juniperus communis, p. 224), elm (Ulmus carpinifolia), \\npeony (Paeonia officinalis, p. 243), and burdock (Arctium lappa, \\np. 65). The text, listing about 600 herbs in all, was to have  \\nan astonishing influence on Western medicine, being the \\nprincipal reference used in Europe until the 17th century.  \\nIt was translated into languages as varied as Anglo-Saxon, \\nPersian, and Hebrew. In 512 ce, De Materia Medica became \\nthe first herbal to feature pictures of the plants discussed. \\nMade for Juliana Arnicia, the daughter of the Roman emperor \\nFlavius Avicius Olybrius, it contained nearly 400 full-page \\ncolor illustrations. \\nGalen (131–200 ce), physician to the Roman emperor  \\nMarcus Aurelius, had an equally profound influence on the \\ndevelopment of herbal medicine. Galen drew inspiration \\nfrom Hippocrates and based his theories on the “theory  \\nof the four humors” (see p. 32). His ideas shaped and, some \\nwould say, distorted medical practice for the next 1,400 years.\\n In India and in China, elaborate medical systems somewhat \\nresembling the theory of the four humors developed (see \\npp. 36–38 and pp. 40–41 respectively) that have endured to \\nthe present day.\\n Though European, Indian, and Chinese systems differ \\nwidely, they all consider that imbalance within the constituent \\nelements of the body is the cause of illness, and that the aim \\nof the healer is to restore balance, often with the aid of \\nherbal remedies.\\nFolk Healing in the Middle Ages\\nThe theories of Galenic, Ayurvedic (Indian), and Chinese \\ntraditional medicine, however, would have meant practically \\nnothing to most of the world’s population. As is still the case \\ntoday for some indigenous peoples who have little access  \\nto conventional medicines, in the past most villages and \\ncommunities relied on the services of local “wise” men and \\nwomen for medical treatment. These healers were almost \\ncertainly ignorant of the conventions of scholastic medicine, \\nyet through apprenticeship and practice in treating illness, \\nattending childbirth, and making use of locally growing herbs \\nas a natural pharmacy, they developed a high level of practical \\nmedical knowledge. \\nGalen’s “four humors,” which he believed \\nmade up the human constitution.\\nFrontispiece decoration for the first illustrated herbal, Dioscorides’ De Materia \\nMedica, produced in Constantinople in 512 ce.\\nUS_018-027_Early_Origins_To_The_19_Century.indd   20 26/02/16   4:42 pm'),\n",

For example, recent excavations at an 11th-century \\nmonastic hospital in Scotland revealed that the monks were \\nusing exotic herbs such as opium poppy (Papaver somniferum, \\np. 244) and marijuana (Cannabis sativa, p. 182) as painkillers and \\nanesthetics. Likewise, the herbalists in Myddfai, a village in \\nSouth Wales, obviously knew of Hippocrates’ writings in the \\n6th century ce and used a wide variety of medicinal plants. \\nThe texts that have been handed down from that herbal \\ntradition are filled with an engaging blend of superstition and \\nwisdom. Two prescriptions from a 13th-century manuscript \\nillustrate the point. The first recipe could have been written by \\na modern, scientifically trained herbalist; the second, one must \\npresume, is pure fancy, and would not choose to try it out! \\nTo Strengthen the Sight\\nTake Eyebright and Red Fennel, a handful of each, and half a handful  \\nof Rue, distil, and wash your eye daily therewith.\\nTo Destroy a Worm in the Tooth\\nTake the root of a cat’s ear, bruise, and apply to the patient’s tooth  \\nfor three nights, and it will kill the worm.\\nIslamic & Indian Medicine 500–1500 ce\\nFolk medicine was largely unaffected by sweeping forces of \\nhistory, but Western scholastic medicine suffered greatly with \\nthe decline of the Roman Empire.\\n It was thanks to the flowering of Arabic culture in  \\n500–1300 ce that the gains of the classical Greek and \\nRoman period were preserved and elaborated. The spread \\nof Islamic culture along North Africa and into present-day  \\nItaly, Spain, and Portugal led to the founding of renowned \\nmedical schools, notably at Cordoba in Spain. The Arabs \\nwere expert pharmacists, blending and mixing herbs to \\nimprove their medicinal effect and their taste. Their \\ncontacts with both Indian and Chinese medical traditions \\nmeant that they had a remarkable range of medical and \\nherbal knowledge to draw on and develop. Avicenna  \\n(980–1037 ce), author of Canon of Medicine , was the  \\nmost famous physician of the day, but perhaps the most \\nunusual herbal connection was made a century before  \\nhis time by Ibn Cordoba, an intrepid Arab seafarer, who \\nbrought ginseng root ( Panax ginseng, p. 118) from China  \\nto Europe. This valuable tonic herb was to be regularly \\nimported into Europe from the 16th century onward.\\n Further east, in India, the 7th century saw a golden age  \\nof medicine. Thousands of students studied Ayurveda at \\nuniversity, especially at Nalanda. There, scholars recorded  \\nthe medical achievements of the time, with advances such \\nas the development of hospitals, maternity homes, and the \\nplanting of medicinal herb gardens.\\nCentral & South American Cures\\nOn the other side of the world, the ancient civilizations  \\nof Central and South America—Maya, Aztec, and Inca—  \\nall had herbal traditions with a profound understanding  \\nof local medicinal plants. One account tells of Incas taking \\nlocal herbalists from what is now Bolivia back to their  \\ncapital Cuzco in Peru because of the herbalists’ great \\ncapabilities, which reputedly included growing penicillin  \\non green banana skins.\\n At the same time, medicine and religion were still closely \\ninterwoven in these cultures, possibly even more so than  \\nin Europe. One gruesome account tells of Aztec sufferers  \\nof skin diseases who sought to appease the god Xipe  \\nTotec by wearing the flayed skins of sacrificial victims. \\nFortunately, a supernatural appeal to the gods  \\nwas not the sole means to relieve this and  \\nother afflictions. Many herbs were available  \\nas alternative treatments, including \\nsarsaparilla (Smilax spp., p. 270), a tonic  \\nand cleansing herb that was used  \\nin treatments for a variety of skin \\ncomplaints including eczema  \\nand psoriasis.\\nGalen and Hippocrates, two of the  \\npreeminent physicians of the classical  \\nera, debate in this imaginary scene \\ndepicted in a fresco.\\nUS_018-027_Early_Origins_To_The_19_Century.indd   21 26/02/16   4:42 pm\\n'),\n",

It not only \\nallowed students from all faiths—Christian, Muslim, and \\nJewish—to study medicine, but it also allowed women to \\ntrain as physicians.

An \\nadage from the Salerno school on sage (Salvia officinalis,  \\np. 131) went as follows: Salvia salvatrix, natura conciliatrix \\n(sage, the savior; nature, the conciliator).\\n By the 12th century, trade with Asia and Africa was \\nexpanding and new herbs and spices were being regularly \\nimported into Europe.

The European herb sage,  \\nfor example, came into use in China, \\nwhere it was considered to be a  \\nvaluable yin tonic.\\n The arrival of Columbus’ ships in  \\nthe Caribbean in 1492 was followed  \\nby the rapid conquest and \\ncolonization of central and \\nsouth America by the Spanish \\nand Portuguese. Along with \\ntheir booty of plundered \\ngold, the conquistadores \\nreturned to the Old World \\nwith previously unheard-of \\nmedicinal plants. Many  \\nof these herbs from the \\nAmericas had highly potent \\nmedicinal actions, and they \\nsoon became available in the apothecaries of the major \\nEuropean cities. Plants such as lignum vitae (Guaiacum \\nofficinale, p. 218) and cinchona (Cinchona spp., p. 80) with \\nstrong medicinal actions were used with greater and lesser \\ndegrees of success as treatments for fever, malaria, syphilis, \\nsmallpox, and other serious illnesses.\\n For most rural communities, however, the only foreign \\nplants that were used medicinally were those that could also \\nbe grown locally as foods. Garlic offers one of the earliest and \\nclearest examples. Originating in central Asia, over time it \\nwas cultivated farther and farther west and was grown in \\nEgypt around 4500 bce. In Homer’s 8th-century bce epic \\npoem The Odyssey, the hero is saved from being changed \\ninto a pig thanks to garlic. The herb was introduced into \\nBritain after the Roman conquest in the 1st century ce, and \\nby the time it reached the island its remarkable medicinal \\npowers were well understood. In later centuries, potatoes \\n(Solanum tuberosum, p. 271) and corn (Zea mays, p. 154), \\nboth native to South America, would become common \\nfoods. These plants have clear medicinal as well as \\nnutritional benefits. Potato juice is a valuable remedy for the \\ntreatment of arthritis, while cornsilk makes an effective \\ndecoction for urinary problems such as cystitis.\\nHealth & Hygiene 1400–1700\\nBetween the 12th and 18th centuries, the influx of exotic \\nmedicinal plants added to an already large number of useful \\nEuropean herbs. Conceivably, an overall improvement of \\nhealth in Europe might have resulted. After all, not only  \\nwere new medicinal plants available, but Europeans had the \\nopportunity to observe the different medical practices of \\npeople in South America, China, Japan, and especially in India, \\nwhere trade was well established. But, in fact, the reverse was \\nthe case. People living in Europe during this period probably \\nexperienced some of the most unhealthy conditions the \\nworld has ever seen. In contrast, Native Americans before \\nthe arrival of Columbus lived longer, healthier lives than their \\ncounterparts in Europe. This fact is unsurprising given the cities \\nof medieval Europe, with their open sewers, overcrowding, \\nand ignorance of simple hygiene.\\n Conditions such as these laid fertile ground for the spread \\nof plague-infested rats from the ports of the Mediterranean \\nthroughout Western Europe. From the mid-14th century \\nonward, plague killed millions, in some cases close to 50 \\npercent of the population. No medical treatment—herbal  \\nor mineral—was able to alter its fatal course. Epidemics \\ncontinued to decimate the cities of Europe and Asia well into \\nthe 18th century. An outbreak in India in 1994 reawakened the \\nterror inspired simply at the mention of the word “plague.”\\n Syphilis was another disease spread by seafarers. It was \\nreputedly brought back from the Caribbean to Naples by \\nColumbus’ crew in the 1490s, spreading quickly throughout \\nEurope and to the rest of the world, reaching China in 1550.\\n European doctors had little success in combating diseases \\nas devastating as plague. The medicine they practiced was \\nbased on the blind acceptance of Galen’s humoral principles. \\nPerhaps if, as in Chinese and Indian medicine, European \\nmedicine had continued to evolve, revising ancient medical \\ntexts and reinterpreting them in the light of new discoveries,  \\nit would have had greater success. As it was, European \\nphysicians were at least as likely to kill their patients  \\nwith bloodletting and toxic minerals  \\nin misbegotten attempts to balance \\nthe humors as they were to cure. \\nIndeed, the increasingly \\nfashionable use of \\nmineral cures such  \\nas mercury led to the \\ngrowth of chemical \\nformulations, culminating  \\nin scientific medicine’s \\nultimate break away from \\nherbal practices.\\nThe Influence  \\nof Paracelsus\\nOne of the key European figures \\nof the 16th century was Paracelsus \\n(1493–1541), a larger-than-life \\ncharacter who rejected the tired \\nrepetition of Galen’s theories in \\nfavor of detailed observation in \\nmedicine. “I have not borrowed \\nfrom Hippocrates, Galen, or \\nanyone else,” he wrote, “having \\nacquired my knowledge from \\nthe best teacher, that is, by \\nGarlic is native to Asia but was readily \\nadopted for its medicinal and culinary \\nqualities in the West.\\n17th-century doctor wearing a  \\ncostume designed to protect against \\ncontamination by the plague.\\nUS_018-027_Early_Origins_To_The_19_Century.indd   23 26/02/16   4:42 pm\\n'),\n",

Though he is known as the \\n“father of chemistry,” he also explored alchemy, which \\nconcerned itself with the transmutation of base materials to \\ngold, and the search for immortal life. Paracelsus also revived \\ninterest in the Doctrine of Signatures—the ancient theory \\nthat held that a plant’s appearance indicated the ailments  \\nit would treat—and affirmed the value of locally grown \\nmedicinal herbs over expensive imported specimens.\\nCulpeper & Printed Herbals\\nParacelsus’ advocacy of local herbs was later fiercely espoused \\nby Nicholas Culpeper (1616–1654). The frontispiece to  \\nhis The English Physitian contains the memorable words: \\n“Containing a Compleat Method of Physick, whereby a Man \\nThe iconoclastic Paracelsus, an alchemist and chemist, was one of the greatest scientists  \\nof the 16th century, and advocated the use of minerals in healing, but only in tightly  \\ncontrolled dosages.\\nmay preserve his Body in Health, or Cure himself, being  \\nSick, for three pence Charge, with such things only as grow  \\nin England, they being most fit for English Bodies.”\\n Wounded during the English Civil War fighting for the \\nCommonwealth, Culpeper championed the needs of the \\nordinary people who could afford neither the services of a \\ndoctor nor the expensive imported herbs and formulations \\nthat doctors generally prescribed. Drawing to some degree \\non Dioscorides, Arabian physicians, and Paracelsus, Culpeper \\ndeveloped a medical system that blended astrology and \\nsound personal experience of the therapeutic uses of local \\nplants. His herbal became an instant “bestseller” and appeared \\nin many subsequent editions. The first herbal published in \\nNorth America, in 1700, was an edition of his herbal.\\n While the popularity of The English Physitian was notable, \\nother herbals also found a place in households. The \\ndevelopment of the printing press in the 15th century brought \\nherbal medicine into homes on a wide scale. Texts such as \\nDioscorides’ De Materia Medica were printed for the first \\ntime, and throughout Europe herbals were published and ran \\nthrough many editions.\\nDeadly Cures 1700–1900\\nBy the end of the 16th century, Paracelsus had become the \\nfigurehead of the new chemical medicine. However, where \\nhe had insisted upon caution in the use of metallic poisons—\\nmercury, antimony, and arsenic—the new medical thinkers \\nwere not so inhibited. Larger and larger doses of the purgative \\nknown as calomel (mercurous chloride, Hg2Cl2) were given \\nto those suffering from syphilis and many other diseases. The \\ntreatment was very often worse than the illness, with some \\npatients dying and many more suffering from the long-term \\nconsequences of mercury poisoning.\\n Hippocrates’ saying “Desperate cases need the most \\ndesperate remedies” was taken very literally, as is evident in \\nthe incredible excess of purging and bleeding that developed \\nover the next three centuries in Europe and North America. \\nThese practices reached a peak in the “heroic” medicine of \\nthe early 19th century. Its leading proponent, Dr. Benjamin \\nRush (1745–1813), maintained that only bloodletting and \\ncalomel were required in medical practice. His position was \\nobviously extreme, but it is clear that in this new climate herbal \\nmedicines were becoming increasingly irrelevant.\\nThe New Rationalism\\nAlong with the new emphasis on chemical cures, modern \\nmedicine came to look askance at the notion of the “vital \\nforce.” Up until the end of the 16th century, nearly all medical \\ntraditions had been based on the concept of working with \\nnature, with the body’s healing capacities, which could be \\nsupported and strengthened with appropriate medicinal \\nherbs.

This French \\nmathematician divided the world into body and mind, nature \\nand ideas. His philosophy ordained that the intangible vital \\nforce that maintains life and governs good health was the \\nprovince of religion rather than of the newly self-aware \\n“science” of medicine. To the new medical establishment, \\ninching its way forward toward scientifically sound medical \\npractices, “supernatural” concepts such as the vital force \\nwere a reminder of the ignorance and superstition that were \\npart and parcel of older healing practices.\\n Even before Descartes’ theories, the rational approach  \\nto scientific and medical exploration was beginning to reap \\nrewards. Slowly, medical understanding of bodily functions \\nwas gaining ground. William Harvey (1578–1657) made a \\ndetailed study of the heart and circulation, proving for the \\nfirst time that, contrary to Galenic thought, the heart \\npumped blood around the body. Published in 1628, \\nhis study is a classic example of the revolution in \\nmedical science.\\n Since Harvey’s time, science has had astounding \\nsuccess in revealing how the body works on a \\nbiochemical level and in distinguishing different \\ndisease processes. However, by comparison it has \\nbeen altogether less successful in developing \\neffective medical treatments for the relief and \\ncure of diseases.\\nThe Gap in the Scientific Approach\\nIn hindsight, it seems as if the new science \\nof medicine could only be born in separation \\nfrom the traditional arts of healing, with which it \\nhad always been intertwined. As a result, even though \\ntraditional medicine has generally lacked scientific explanation, \\nit has frequently been far ahead of medical science in the \\nway it has been applied therapeutically. In American Indian \\nMedicine (University of Oklahoma Press, 1970), Virgil Vogel \\nprovides a good example of “ignorant” folk medicine \\noutstripping scientific understanding in therapeutic application:\\n “During the bitter cold winter of 1535–6, the three ships \\nof Jacques Cartier were frozen fast in the fathom-deep ice of \\nthe St Lawrence River near the site of Montreal. Isolated by \\nfour feet of snow, the company of 110 men subsisted on \\nthe fare stored in the holds of their ships. Soon scurvy was \\nso rampant among them that by mid-March, 25 men had \\ndied and the others, ‘only three or foure excepted,’ were \\nso ill that hope for their recovery was abandoned. As the \\ncrisis deepened Cartier had the good fortune to encounter \\nonce again the local Indian chief, Domagaia, who had cured \\nhimself of the same disease with ‘the juice and sappe of a \\ncertain tree’. The Indian women gathered branches of the \\nmagical tree, ‘boiling the bark and leaves for a decoction, \\nand placing the dregs upon the legs.’ All those so treated \\nrapidly recovered their health, and the Frenchmen \\nmarvelled at the curative skill of the natives.”\\n Naturally, the Native Americans had not heard of vitamin C \\ndeficiency, which causes scurvy, nor would they have been able \\nto explain in rational terms why the treatment worked. Indeed, \\nit was not until 1753 that James Lind (1716–1794), a British \\nnaval surgeon, inspired partly by Cartier’s account, published \\nA Treatise of the Scurvy , which showed conclusively that the \\ndisease could be prevented by eating fresh greens, vegetables, \\nand fruit, and was caused by their lack in the diet. James Lind’s \\nwork is a marvellous example of what can be achieved by \\ncombining a systematic and scientific approach with traditional \\nherbal knowledge.\\nThe symbol for “om”— \\nlife force—is used by \\nfollowers of the Indian \\npractice of Ayurveda  \\nas a focus for meditation.\\nUS_018-027_Early_Origins_To_The_19_Century.indd   25 26/02/16   4:42 pm\\n'),\n",

Dr. William \\nWithering (1741–1799), a conventionally trained \\ndoctor with a long interest in medicinal plants, \\nstarted to investigate foxglove after encountering \\na family recipe for curing dropsy (water \\nretention). He found that in some regions of \\nEngland, foxglove was traditionally used to \\ntreat this condition, which is often one of \\nthe indications of a failing heart. In 1785,  \\nhe published Account of the Foxglove, \\ndocumenting dozens of carefully \\nrecorded case histories, and showing \\nhow foxglove’s powerful (and \\npotentially dangerous) active \\nconstituents, now known as cardiac \\nglycosides, made it a valuable plant \\nmedicine for dropsy. Cardiac \\nglycosides remain in common \\nuse to the present day. Y et \\ndespite this clearcut example \\nof the possibilities inherent  \\nin a marriage of herbal \\nmedicine and scientific \\nmethod, conventional \\nmedicine was to take \\nanother path in the  \\n19th century.\\nLaboratory versus \\nNature\\nFrom the early 19th \\ncentury, the chemical \\nlaboratory began to \\nregularly supplant Mother \\nNature as the source  \\nof medicines. In 1803, \\nnarcotic alkaloids were \\nisolated from the opium \\npoppy (Papaver somniferum, \\np. 244). A year later, inulin was \\nextracted from elecampane \\n(Inula helenium, p. 107). In 1838, \\nsalicylic acid, a chemical forerunner \\nof aspirin, was isolated from white \\nwillow bark (Salix alba, p. 129), and \\nwas first synthesized in the laboratory \\nin 1860. From this point on, herbal \\nmedicine and biomedicine were to take separate paths. \\nAspirin, an entirely new chemical formulation, was  \\nfirst developed in Germany in 1899. But this was still an  \\nearly step. For the time being, the influence of the \\nuniversities, medical schools, and laboratories of Europe \\nwould remain limited, and herbal medicine would prevail  \\nas the predominant form of treatment for most people \\naround the world.\\nNew Frontiers, New Herbal Medicines\\nWherever Europeans settled during the great migrations of \\nthe 18th and 19th centuries—North America, South America, \\nsouthern Africa, or Australia—much of the European \\nmedicine familiar from home was either unavailable or \\nprohibitively expensive. Settlers came to learn that native \\npeoples were a wellspring of information about the \\nmedicinal virtues of indigenous plants. For example, \\nEuropean settlers in southern Africa learned about the \\ndiuretic properties of buchu (Barosma betulina, p. 71) from \\nnative peoples; and Australian settlers came to understand \\nthe remarkable antiseptic properties of tea tree (Melaleuca \\nalternifolia, p. 112) from observing the medicinal practices of \\nthe Aborigines. Mexican herbal medicine as it exists today is \\na blend of Aztec, Mayan, and Spanish herbs and practices.\\n In North America, native herbalists were particularly \\nadept at healing external wounds and bites—being superior \\nin many respects to their European counterparts in this area \\nof medicine. This is not surprising, given the range of highly \\nOpium poppy, native to Asia, yields a resin that has long been smoked for its narcotic  \\neffect. The main active constituent, morphine, was first isolated in the laboratory in  \\n1803 and is used to relieve pain.\\nIn the 18th century, the physician William Withering \\ndocumented foxglove’s ability to restore a failing heart.\\nUS_018-027_Early_Origins_To_The_19_Century.indd   26 26/02/16   4:42 pm'),\n",

Over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries, \\nas pioneers moved west across the frontier territory, new \\nplants were constantly being added to the official record  \\nof healing herbs. In addition to the three species mentioned \\nabove, about 170 native plants were listed in The Pharmacopeia \\nof the United States.\\nSamuel Thomson & his Followers\\nLobelia was one of the key herbs, along with cayenne  \\n(Capsicum frutescens, p. 74), advocated by Samuel Thomson \\n(1769–1843), an unorthodox herbal practitioner who believed \\nthat all illness resulted from cold. His simple approach was \\nentirely at odds with the conventional practices of his time  \\n(see North America, p. 50). Thomson’s methods were often \\nvery effective and were well suited to the needs of people \\nliving in frontier territory. His system of medicine—in many \\nways an early form of naturopathy, in which ill health is \\ntreated with naturally grown food, sunlight, fresh air, and \\nnatural medicines—became extraordinarily popular, with \\nmillions of people across North America following his \\nmethods. Thomson’s success waned as other \\nmore sophisticated herbal approaches were \\ndeveloped—those of the Eclectics and \\nPhysiomedicalists, for example—in the \\nfertile medical world of 19th-century \\nAmerica, which also saw the birth  \\nof osteopathy (a system of healing \\nbased upon the manipulation \\nof bones) and chiropractic  \\n(a similar system primarily \\ninvolving manipulation of  \\nthe spine).\\nWestern Influences on \\nAsian Medicine\\nAcross the world in \\nChina, Thomson’s \\npractices might have \\nbeen looked on with \\na measure of surprise, \\nbut they would have \\nbeen familiar. In Chinese \\nmedicine, there has \\nalways been a debate \\nas to what degree \\nillness arises from  \\ncold, and to what  \\ndegree it arises from heat.  \\nThe Shanghanlun (On Cold-Induced Maladies), written in the 2nd \\ncentury ce , and revised and reinterpreted in commentaries \\nover the last 1,800 years, recommends the herb cinnamon \\n(Cinnamomum spp., p. 81) as a principal remedy when the \\npatient “shivers with fever, breathes heavily, and feels \\nnauseous.” In the 14th century, Wang Lu distinguished \\nbetween cold-induced illness and febrile illness, and treated \\nthem in different ways, and this distinction was elaborated in \\ngreater and greater detail by different Chinese herbalists right \\nup to the 19th century.\\n During the early 19th century, the influence of Western \\nbiomedicine was beginning to affect traditional practices in both \\nChina and India. This was certainly beneficial in many respects. \\nThe judicious incorporation of scientific principles and methods \\ninto traditional herbal healing offers the possibility of greatly \\nrefining the effectiveness of treatment.\\n But in India under British rule, Western medicine eventually \\nbecame the only alternative. Ayurveda was seen as inferior to \\nbiomedicine (see India & the Middle East, p. 39). Western \\npractice was introduced not as a complement to traditional \\nmedicine, but rather as a means to supplant it. According to \\none authority, “before 1835 Western physicians and their \\nIndian counterparts exchanged knowledge; thereafter only \\nWestern medicine was recognised as legitimate and the \\nEastern systems were actively discouraged” (Robert \\nSvoboda, Ayurveda, Life, Health and Longevity, 1992).\\n In China, the influx of Western ideas was less traumatic. \\nIncreasing numbers of Chinese medical students studied \\nWestern medicine, but this did not stop the continuing \\ndevelopment of traditional herbal practice. By and large, \\neach tradition was recognized as having both advantages  \\nand disadvantages.\\nHerbalism Outlawed 1850–1900\\nIn Europe, conventional medicine was seeking to establish  \\na monopoly for its own type of practice. In 1858, the British \\nParliament was asked to impose legislation banning the \\npractice of medicine by anyone who had not been trained in \\na conventional medical school. Fortunately, this proposal was \\nrejected, but in countries such as France, Spain, and Italy, and \\nin some states of the U.S., it became illegal to practice herbal \\nmedicine without an orthodox qualification. Herbalists were \\nforced to risk fines or imprisonment simply for providing \\nherbal medicine to patients who had sought their help.\\n In Britain, concerns such as these, combined with a desire \\nto establish Western herbal medicine as an alternative to \\nconventional practices, particularly in the industrial cities  \\nof the North of England, led to the formation in 1864 of the \\nNational Institute of Medical Herbalists, the first professional \\nbody of herbal practitioners in the world. Its history is an \\nexample of how tenacious herbal practitioners have had  \\nto be simply to retain their right to give safe, gentle, and \\neffective herbal medicines to their patients.\\nGinseng has been used \\nas a tonic remedy in \\nChinese medicine for \\nat least 5,000 years. \\nUS_018-027_Early_Origins_To_The_19_Century.indd   27 26/02/16   4:42 pm\\n'),\n",

However, many might be surprised to discover that,  \\nfor much of the last century, herbal medicines have been the primary form of treatment,  \\neven in Western countries.\\nEven as late as the 1930s, around 90 percent of medicines \\nprescribed by doctors or sold over the counter were herbal \\nin origin. It is only during the last 70 years that laboratory-\\nproduced medicines have become the norm. During the  \\nFirst World War (1914–1918), for example, garlic (Allium \\nsativum, p. 59) and sphagnum moss (Sphagnum spp.) were \\nused by the ton in the battle trenches to dress wounds and  \\nto treat infections. Garlic is an excellent natural antibiotic,  \\nand was the most effective antiseptic available at the time, \\nand sphagnum moss, gathered \\nfrom the moorlands, makes  \\na natural aseptic dressing.\\nScience & Medicine\\nThe development of new \\nmedicines in the laboratory—\\neither extracted from medicinal \\nplants or synthesized—stretches \\nback to the early 19th century, \\nwhen chemists first isolated \\nconstituents such as morphine, \\nfrom opium poppy (Papaver \\nsomniferum, p. 244), and cocaine, \\nfrom coca (Erythroxylum coca, p. 206). From that time onward, \\nscientists made tremendous progress in understanding how \\nisolated chemicals affect the body, as well as how the body \\nworks in health and disease. From the 1860s, scientists—most \\nnotably Louis Pasteur (1822–1895)—began to identify the \\nmicroorganisms that were ultimately responsible for causing \\ninfectious diseases, such as tuberculosis and malaria.\\n Naturally enough, the first aim of those engaged in medical \\nresearch was to seek out medicines that would act as “magic \\nbullets,” directly attacking the microorganisms concerned and \\nridding the body of the threat. This eventually led to the \\ndiscovery, or, more accurately, the rediscovery of penicillin  \\nby a number of medical researchers, most notably Alexander \\nFleming (1881–1955) in 1929. However, while 20th-century \\nscientists were the first to scientifically evaluate antibiotics as \\nmedicines, they were not the first to employ them in healing. \\nAntibiotic molds had been grown and used to combat \\ninfection in ancient Egypt, 14th-century Peru, and in recent \\nEuropean folk medicine.\\n In the decades following the Second World War (1939– \\n1945), when antibiotics first came into use, it seemed as \\nthough a new era had dawned in which infection could  \\nbe conquered, and life-threatening diseases such as syphilis, \\npneumonia, and tuberculosis would cease to be major causes \\nof death in the developed world. Modern medicine also \\nprovided other highly effective drugs such as steroid anti-\\ninflammatories, and it seemed as if it was simply a question  \\nof time until cures for most illnesses were found. \\nAscendancy of Biomedicine\\nAs Americans and Europeans became accustomed to \\nmedication that led to an almost instant short-term \\nimprovement in symptoms (if not in underlying health), herbal \\nmedicines came to be seen by the public as outmoded and \\nineffective. Increasingly, the practice of herbal medicine was \\noutlawed in North America and most of Europe, while the \\nwealthy in developing countries abandoned herbal medicine \\nin favor of the new treatments available.\\n This was in no small part due to the medical profession \\nitself, which saw herbal medicine as a throwback to the \\nsuperstitions of the past. From the late 19th century \\nonward, the aim of organizations such as the American \\nMedical Association and the British Medical Association had \\nbeen to monopolize conventional medical practice. Herbal \\nmedicine thus neared extinction in many countries, especially  \\nin the U.S. and Britain. In Britain, for example, from 1941 until \\n1968 it was illegal to practice herbal medicine without \\nmedical qualifications.\\nThe Tide Turns\\nAlthough there were spectacular \\nsuccesses with modern \\nchemical medicines,  \\nthere were also horrific \\ndisasters, most notably \\nthe thalidomide \\ntragedy in 1962 in \\nBritain and Germany, \\nwhen 3,000 deformed \\nbabies were born to \\nmothers who had taken \\nthe drug for morning \\nsickness during pregnancy. \\nThis event marked a \\nturning point in the \\npublic’s opinion of \\nchemical medicines. \\nLouis Pasteur was a pioneer in the \\nidentification of bacteria. \\nAn electron micrograph of the parasite \\nPlasmodium.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\Encyclopedia Of Herbal Medicine_2.pdf', 'page': 30}, page_content='29 20th century onward\\nPeople began to realize that a serious cost could accompany \\nthe benefits of treatment with modern pharmaceutical  \\ndrugs. This, and the factors described below, have brought \\nabout a sea change in public perceptions of the value of \\nherbal medicine.\\nThe Chinese Example\\nHerbal medicine experienced a major gain in fortune in  \\n1949 in China, when Mao Zedong and the Communist  \\nRed Army gained control of the country.\\n Traditional Western medicine by that time was well \\nestablished in China, but most of the population had little \\nhope of access to modern hospitals, let alone to new drugs. \\nOut of necessity, traditional Chinese medicine—essentially \\nherbal medicine and acupuncture—once more began to  \\nbe used alongside Western conventional medicine. The \\nauthorities aimed to provide the best of both worlds. Five \\nteaching hospitals for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) \\nwere established, where it was taught on a scientific basis.  \\nIn addition, great efforts were made to improve the quality  \\nof plant medicines.\\n Contrary to the trend in conventional Western medicine \\nthat makes the patient ever more dependent upon the \\ndoctor and high-tech machinery, TCM, like other forms  \\nof complementary medicine, stresses the patient’s personal \\nresponsibility for his or her own cure, encouraging a holistic \\napproach to treatment.\\n In the 1960s, China also established a system of “barefoot \\ndoctors.” After a period of basic medical instruction that \\nblended herbal medicine, acupuncture, and Western practices, \\nthese practitioners were sent out to provide health care  \\nfor the millions of rural Chinese too remote from cities  \\nto benefit from the facilities available there. The barefoot \\ndoctors in the late 1960s became a model for the World \\nHealth Organization, which created a strategy of including \\ntraditional herbal practitioners in planning for the health care \\nneeds of developing countries.\\nWestern Medicine & Herbal Practices\\nFurther to the initiative by the World Health Organization, \\nexperience has shown that traditional (usually herbal) and \\nWestern medicine can indeed work well in tandem, although \\nthe relationship is often quite complex. J. M. Janzen’s The Quest \\nfor Therapy in Lower Zaïre (University of California Press, 1978) \\ndescribes one such interaction in Africa:\\n “The people of Zaïre recognize the advantages of  \\nWestern medicine and seek its surgery, drugs, and hospital  \\ncare, but contrary to what might have been expected, native \\ndoctors, prophets, and traditional consultations among \\nkinsmen do not disappear with the adoption of Western \\nmedicine. Rather a [working relationship] has developed  \\nin which different forms of therapy play complementary rather \\nthan competitive roles in the thoughts and lives of the people.”\\n The high cost of Western medical treatment is another \\nfactor that has encouraged people and governments to \\nre-examine traditional healing. In China, Mexico, Cuba, Egypt, \\nGhana, India, and Mongolia, to give but a few examples, herbal \\nmedicines are being cultivated in greater quantities, and are \\nbeing used to some degree by conventional as well as \\ntraditional practitioners.\\n Likewise, different types of treatment have evolved \\nto meet the variety of needs within a population. India offers \\nan extraordinary example of the kind of choices available  \\nin types of medical care. Alongside physicians trained in \\nconventional Western medicine, there are medically trained \\nAyurvedic practitioners, traditional Ayurvedic practitioners, \\nlocal healers, and homeopaths.\\nChanging Attitudes\\nPerhaps the most important factor behind the growing \\ninterest in complementary medicine is the poor state of \\nhealth in Western societies. Conventional medicine has by \\nand large brought serious infectious diseases under control, \\nalthough there are worrying signs that infectious organisms \\nare becoming resistant to antibiotic treatment, largely as a \\nresult of their indiscriminate use. Chronic illness, however, \\nseems to be on the increase. Probably around 50 percent  \\nof people in Western countries daily take one or more \\nconventional medicines—for conditions as diverse as high \\nblood pressure, asthma, arthritis, and depression. Many \\nWestern countries such as the U.S. and France spend \\nastronomical sums on health care, yet despite this massive \\ninvestment, much of the population remains demonstrably \\nunhealthy. Even the significant increase in life expectancy in \\ndeveloped countries is starting to go into reverse, perhaps  \\na result of environmental pollutants and toxic accumulation \\nwithin the body.\\n“Slash-and-burn” farming in the rainforest of Brazil results in the eradication of native \\nmedicinal plants. Efforts are now under way to provide local farmers with alternative \\nmeans of profiting from the land.\\nUS_028-031_20th_Century_and_Beyond.indd   29 26/02/16   4:42 pm\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\Encyclopedia Of Herbal Medicine_2.pdf', 'page': 31}, page_content='30\\nThe developmen T  of herbal medicine\\nOver the years, changes in public awareness have led to a \\nrenewed interest in herbal medicine. In fact, some herbal \\npreparations are now so commonly used that they are \\naccepted as a part of everyday life. One of many possible \\nexamples is evening primrose oil, which is used by hundreds  \\nof thousands of women in Britain to help relieve premenstrual \\nsyndrome. It is extracted from the seeds of Oenothera biennis  \\n(p. 241), a North American plant. Peppermint oil (Mentha x \\npiperita, p. 114), prescribed for irritable bowel syndrome and \\nother gut problems, is another example, while senna (Cassia \\nsenna, p. 75), a simple, effective treatment for short-term \\nconstipation, is one of the most frequently used medicines \\nthroughout the world.\\n The growing awareness of how our lives as human beings \\nare interwoven with the fate of our planet also reinforces the \\nvalue of herbal medicines. As long as care is taken to prevent \\noverharvesting, herbal medicine is ecologically in tune with \\nthe environment.\\nHerbalism & Holism\\nThe “germ theory of disease,” which holds that illness  \\nsprings from contact with an infectious organism, remains  \\nthe dominant view in mainstream medicine. Many people, \\nhowever, recognize that this is only part of the picture. \\nWhile illnesses such as cholera and typhoid are highly \\ninfectious and are indeed likely to be caught by almost \\nanyone, many infectious diseases are not transmitted \\nautomatically from one person to another. The question \\narises, therefore, what weakness in the patient has allowed \\nthe “seed” of infection to find fertile ground? Unlike much \\nconventional medical practice, which focuses on eradicating  \\nthe “bug” or abnormal condition, herbal medicine seeks to \\ntreat the weakness that gave rise to ill health, and sets this  \\nin the context of the patient’s life as a whole. A complex  \\nweb of factors may lie behind the onset of illness. While \\nbodily signs and symptoms are the most obvious indicators, \\ndietary, emotional, and spiritual factors may be of  \\nequal importance.\\n Our bodies contain over one hundred trillion cells, which \\ncollectively must function in harmony if good health is to be \\nmaintained. Used wisely, herbs work in tune with our bodies, \\nstimulating, supporting, or restraining different sets of cells in \\ntheir allotted tasks within the body, encouraging a return to \\nnormal balanced function. Remedies aim to strengthen the \\npatient’s own resistance, improve the vitality of weakened \\ntissue, and encourage the body’s innate ability to return to \\ngood health.\\n Of course, for people with severe acute illnesses, it may  \\nbe too late to use an herbal approach to treatment. In these \\ncircumstances, strong-acting conventional medicines such  \\nas heart drugs, antibiotics, and painkillers, as well as surgery, \\ncan all be lifesavers. However, a health-care system that  \\nis carefully attuned to the needs of the patient might well \\nprovide herbal remedies as a first line of treatment, with \\nconventional medicines held in reserve to be used only  \\nwhen necessary.\\nEvidence in Support of Herbal Cures\\nMany medical scientists still find it hard to accept that natural \\nmedicines, with their complex chemical makeup and variable \\nconstituents, can be as good as chemical cures in treating illness. \\nHowever, as more and more research reveals that herbal \\nmedicines can be as effective as conventional medicines—and are \\nfar safer—this thinking is beginning to change. \\n This is well illustrated by the change in attitude toward  \\nSt. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum, p. 106)—a European \\nplant commonly taken as an antidepressant. Extracts of the \\nherb are now scientifically recognized as having value in mild \\nto moderate depression. Since the 1980s, over 30 clinical \\ntrials have found extracts of St. John’s wort to be as effective \\nas conventional antidepressants and to have far fewer side \\neffects. In 15 of these trials, the herbal extract produced \\nfewer side effects than the placebo (or inert “medicine”) \\nused as a comparison. Other investigations suggest that St. \\nJohn’s wort may have a role in countering viral infections, \\npromoting wound healing, and helping withdrawal from \\naddiction, especially from alcohol.\\n As is so often the case, research has confirmed traditional \\nviews. In the 16th century, Paracelsus (see p. 23) had this  \\nto say about the herb: “Nothing chases away disease like \\nstrength. Therefore, we should seek medicines with power \\nand strength to overcome whatever illnesses they are used \\nagainst. From this it follows that God has given to Perforatum \\n[St. John’s wort] the strength to chase [away] the ghosts of \\nnature…and all downheartedness.”\\n As a result of scientific research, today’s practitioners have \\nan important advantage—how the plant works in the body is \\nEvening primrose is native to North America and has been used to treat a wide range \\nof conditions, including premenstrual syndrome, asthma, whooping cough, digestive \\ndisorders, and eczema.\\nUS_028-031_20th_Century_and_Beyond.indd   30 26/02/16   4:42 pm'),\n",

As a result, the \\nindustry has invested vast resources into screening the active \\nconstituents of medicinal plants from all over the world.  \\nThe drug taxol, first extracted from the Pacific yew (Taxus \\nbrevifolia), and one of the most effective treatments for \\nbreast cancer, was developed in this way.\\n In this search through the plant world it is likely that  \\nother remarkable medicines will be found, though far  \\nfewer new drugs have been successfully developed via this \\nresearch than was originally anticipated. In fact, there is a key \\nproblem to this approach, for it is geared to the production  \\nof isolated plant chemicals which can then be synthesized  \\nand patented. With a patent, a company can make a profit, \\nrecouping the massive investment required to research  \\nand develop new medicines. Herbs, however, are whole, \\nnaturally occurring remedies. They cannot and should  \\nnot be patented. Even if the major \\npharmaceutical companies were able  \\nto find an herb such as St. John’s wort, \\nwhich proved to be more effective \\nand safer than conventional \\nmedicines, they would prefer  \\nto develop synthetic chemical \\ndrugs rather than  \\nplant medicines.\\nHerbal Synergy\\nOne word more than  \\nany other separates herbal \\nfrom conventional medicine: \\nsynergy. When the whole plant \\nis used rather than extracted \\nconstituents, the different \\nparts interact, often, it is thought, \\nproducing a greater therapeutic \\neffect than the equivalent dosage \\nof isolated active constituents \\nthat are generally preferred in \\nconventional medicine.\\n Increasingly, research shows \\nthat herbs such as ephedra \\n(Ephedra sinica, p. 95), hawthorn \\n(Crataegus oxyacantha , p. 87), \\nginkgo (Ginkgo biloba, p. 100),  \\nand lily of the valley (Convallaria \\nmajalis, p. 194) have a greater-\\nthan-expected medicinal benefit \\nthanks to the natural combination \\nof constituents within the whole \\nplant. In some cases, the medicinal value of the herb may be \\ndue entirely to the combination of substances and cannot  \\nbe reproduced by one or two “active” constituents alone.\\nThe Future of Herbal Medicine\\nThe main issue for the future of herbal medicine is whether \\nmedicinal plants, and the traditional knowledge that informs \\ntheir use, will be valued for what they are—an immense \\nresource of safe, economical, ecologically balanced \\nmedicines—or whether they will be yet another area of life \\nto be exploited for short-term profit.\\n Another issue is convincing skeptics in the medical  \\nworld that herbal medicine is not just a poor substitute for \\nconventional medicine, but a valuable form of treatment in its \\nown right. In trials into the effect of certain Chinese herbs \\non patients with eczema at London’s Royal Free Hospital in \\nthe early 1990s, conventional specialists were astonished \\nwhen the addition of one extra herb to a Chinese formula \\ncontaining 10 others resulted in a dramatic improvement in a \\npreviously unresponsive patient. This story offers evidence of \\nthe skill and art involved in herbal practice. In tailoring the \\nremedy to suit the individual needs of the patient and in \\ntreating the underlying cause, major improvements were \\nmade. This approach is a far cry from the standard medical \\nview of using a single drug to treat a single disease.\\n In India and China, there have been university courses in \\nherbal medicine for decades. In the West this process has \\nbeen slower, with undergraduate courses emerging only in \\nthe last 20 years.

In Europe, the principal model for understanding \\nand explaining illness was the “theory of the four humors,” which persisted \\nwell into the 17th century. It was laid down by Galen (131–201 ce), \\nphysician to the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. Galen was born in \\nPergamum, and part of his medical practice involved caring for the gladiators \\nof the city, which gave him the opportunity to learn about anatomy and the \\nremedies best suited to healing wounds. He wrote literally hundreds of \\nbooks and had a crucial influence on European medicine for over 1,500 \\nyears. To this day, plant medicines are sometimes called Galenicals to \\ndistinguish them from synthesized drugs.\\nThe Theory of the Four Humors\\nGalen developed his ideas from the texts of Hippocrates (460–c. 377 bce) \\nand Aristotle (384–322 bce), who in turn had been influenced by Egyptian \\nand Indian ideas. Hippocrates, expanding on the early belief that the world \\nwas made up of the elements fire, air, earth, and water, classified herbs as \\nhaving hot, dry, cold, and moist properties. Aristotle developed and endorsed \\nthe theory of the four humors. According to the theory, four principal \\nfluids—or humors—exist within the body: blood, choler (yellow bile), \\nmelancholy (black bile), and phlegm. The “ideal” person bore all four  \\nin equal proportion. However, in most people, one or more humors \\npredominate, giving rise to particular temperaments or characters. For \\ninstance, excess choler produced a choleric-type person, who was likely  \\nto be short-tempered, sallow, ambitious, and vengeful. Galen also believed \\nthat pneuma (spirit) was taken in with each breath, and processed in  \\nthe body to form the “vital spirit.” Vitality and health depended upon the \\nproper balance between the four humors and the four elements and  \\nthe correct mix with the inspired pneuma.\\nInfluence of Classical Herbalists\\nTwo other classical writers strongly influenced the European \\nherbal tradition. Dioscorides (40–90 ce), a Greek-born Roman \\narmy surgeon, wrote the classical world’s most comprehensive \\nbook on herbal medicines, De Materia Medica, based on \\nobservations of nearly 600 plants. Pliny the Elder (23–79 \\nce) drew together writings from over 400 authors in \\nhis Natural History, recording, among other things, \\nherbal lore of the time. Much traditional European \\nknowledge of medicinal herbs comes from \\nDioscorides and Pliny. One of the most \\ninteresting herbs mentioned by both is \\nEurope\\nDespite regional variations, European herbal \\npractices largely arose from the common root  \\nof the classical tradition. Today, herbalism is \\nincreasingly popular in Europe, and in some countries it is  \\nwidely practiced by orthodox medical practitioners as well as  \\nby qualified herbalists.\\nThe developmenT  of herbal medicine\\nUS_032-035_Europe.indd   32 26/02/16   4:42 pm'),\n",

It was recommended by Dioscorides for many \\nailments, including sleeplessness and inflammation of the eyes.\\n With the collapse of the Roman empire in the 5th century ce, the \\ndebate about how illness arose and how it should be treated shifted to  \\nthe East. By the 9th century, Islamic physicians had translated much of Galen’s \\nwork into Arabic, and his ideas affected the development of Arabic medicine \\ninto the Middle Ages, influencing Avicenna (980–1037). Later in the \\nMiddle Ages, Galen’s writings were translated back into Latin from the \\nArabic and, for 400 years, his ideas held sway and were diligently applied in \\nEuropean medical practice. Even in the 16th and 17th centuries, students \\nin university medical schools were given an academic training in the \\nprinciples of the humoral system, as established by Galen. They learned \\nhow to diagnose an imbalance of the humors, and the methods of \\nrestoring equilibrium, primarily bloodletting and purging ( see pp. 23–24).\\nPrinting & Herbal Medicine\\nThe invention of printing in the 15th century changed the face of herbal \\nmedicine in Europe. Before that time, European folk medicine had been \\nhanded down from generation to generation. While some early herbals \\nwere written in Anglo-Saxon, Icelandic, and Welsh, for example, for the \\nmost part the tradition was orally based.\\n During the following centuries, herbals were published throughout \\nEurope in different languages, making standardized catalogs of herbs and \\ntheir applications accessible to the general public, not just to those who \\nunderstood Latin. As literacy rates rose, women in particular used the \\nadvice in the herbals to treat their families. \\nThe ancient theory of the four humors holds that four fluids within the body—black bile, phlegm, yellow bile, \\nand blood—correspond to the four elements (earth, water, air, and fire), the four seasons, and other aspects \\nof the natural world. Until the 17th century, physicians believed that an imbalance of the humoral system \\ncaused mental and physical illness.\\nEurop E\\nUS_032-035_Europe.indd   33 26/02/16   4:42 pm\\n'),\n",

In other \\ninstances they were based directly on first-hand experience—the English \\nherbals of John Gerard (1597) and Nicholas Culpeper (1652) being  \\ngood examples.\\n John Gerard’s The Herball is clearly the work of a horticulturist, rather \\nthan of an herbal practitioner, but is nonetheless a mine of information. \\nThe book includes many plants that had been recently brought back to \\nEurope by explorers and traders.\\n Culpeper’s The English Physitian has been widely used as a practical \\nreference book ever since its publication. It is a rich blend of personal  \\nand practical experience, traditional European medicine, and astrological \\nthought. Each herb is assigned a “temperature,” a use within the humoral \\nsystem, and a ruling planet and star sign. Like Dioscorides’ De Materia \\nMedica, it has the merit of being based on close observation and extensive \\nexperience in the use of herbal medicines.\\nForeign Herbs & Synthesized Drugs\\nThe growing use of foreign herbs in the 17th century prompted heated \\ndebate about the relative value of indigenous European herbs, but for the \\nmajority of the population this was irrelevant as the imported herbs were \\nwell out of their price range. In the end, it created a rift in herbal medicine. \\nPoor and rural peoples used locally available herbs, while affluent city-\\ndwellers and aristocrats purchased plants of foreign origin, prescribed  \\nby university-trained physicians. By the beginning of the 18th century, \\napproximately 70 percent of plant medicines stocked by European \\napothecaries were imported. Over time, this city-based herbalism evolved \\ninto conventional scientific medicine, which in turn rejected its herbal roots \\nand regarded plant medicines as inferior.\\n Once conventional medicine established its monopoly of practice—in \\nmost European countries by the end of the 19th century—it became (and \\nin many cases still remains) illegal to practice herbalism without medical \\ncertification. In Greece, traditional herbalists, known as komboyannites, were \\npersecuted, and the word itself became an insult meaning “trickster”  \\nor “quack.” In France and Italy, experienced traditional herbalists were \\nimprisoned for providing treatment to their patients. The renaissance in \\nherbal medicine that has occurred in the last 40 years offers hope that \\nofficial censure will change.\\nModern Practitioners\\nThe pattern of herbal medicine \\nacross Europe today is remarkably \\nvaried, but a common thread runs \\nthrough the different traditions and \\npractices. Most European herbalists \\nuse orthodox methods of diagnosis, \\nlooking for signs of infection and \\ninflammation, for example. However, \\nmost also try to establish a broad, \\nholistic picture, placing the illness in \\nthe context of the patient’s life as a \\nwhole.

Alpine \\nplants such as arnica (Arnica montana, p. 172) and pulsatilla (Anemone \\npulsatilla, p. 168) are much used in Swiss, German, Italian, and French herbal \\nmedicine, while comfrey (Symphytum officinale, p. 138) is particularly well \\nliked in Britain.

Sound advice on a healthy diet and lifestyle, \\nincluding food herbs, such as turmeric (Curcuma longa, p. 90), might well \\nprove more beneficial than conventionally prescribed drugs in helping  \\nan aging population to stay healthy for longer. \\n Nevertheless, in several European countries herbal medicines are \\nroutinely prescribed, offering doctors a choice of gentle-acting \\ntreatments for chronic and more minor health problems. In Germany and \\nPoland, herbal medicines can be frontline treatments for digestive disorders \\nand chronic problems such as arthritis. This approach leaves conventional \\ndrug treatments available for more acute or serious conditions. \\n In contrast, a barely reported trend is that more and more people are \\ngrowing medicinal plants.

He and his pupils recorded medical knowledge in treatises \\nthat would in turn influence Charaka, the scholar who is thought to have \\nwritten the Charaka Samhita. This compendium of writings, in the form \\nthat it has come down to us, dates from around 100 ce and describes \\n341 plant medicines as well as medicines of animal and mineral origin. The \\nsecond major work was the Susruta Samhita, dating from around the same \\ntime; it displays detailed knowledge of surgery, especially plastic surgery, \\nand is still consulted today.\\nThe Influence of Ayurveda\\nOther traditions of medicine share common roots with Ayurveda, and \\nAyurveda has some claim to being the oldest surviving medical tradition  \\nin the world. From the time of  \\nthe Buddha (563–483 bce) onward, \\nAyurvedic medical ideas and \\npractices spread across Asia, \\naccompanying the spread of \\nBuddhism itself.

In Ayurveda, the origin of all aspects of existence is pure \\nintellect or consciousness. Energy and matter are one. Energy is \\nmanifested in five elements—ether, air, fire, water, and earth—which \\ntogether form the basis of all matter. In the body, ether is present in the \\ncavities of the mouth, abdomen, digestive tract, thorax, and lungs. Air  \\nis manifested in the movements of the muscles, pulsations of the heart, \\nexpansion and contraction of the lungs, and the workings of the digestive \\ntract and the nervous system. Fire is manifested in the digestive system, \\nmetabolism, body temperature, vision, and intelligence. Water is present  \\nin the digestive juices, salivary glands, mucous membranes, blood, and \\ncytoplasm. Earth exists in the nails, skin, and hair, as well as in the elements \\nthat hold the body together: bones, cartilage, muscles, and tendons.\\n The five elements manifest in the functioning of the five senses, and  \\nthey are closely related to our ability to perceive and interact with the \\nenvironment in which we live. In Ayurveda, ether, air, fire, water and earth \\ncorrespond to hearing, touch, vision, taste, and smell respectively.\\nThe Doshas & Health\\nThe five elements combine to form three basic forces, known as the \\ntridoshas, which exist in everything in the universe, and influence all mental \\nand physical processes. From ether and air, the air principle vata is created; \\nfire and water yield the fire principle pitta; and earth and water produce \\nthe water principle kapha. The principles correspond closely to the three \\nhumors of Tibetan medicine and somewhat resemble Galen’s theory of \\nthe four humors (see p. 32).\\n According to Ayurveda, we are all born with a particular balance of \\ndoshas. The proportions are largely determined by the balance of doshas \\nin our parents at the time of our conception. Our body type, \\nThe chakras are represented in this figure. India’s medical \\nsystem, Ayurveda, identifies seven energy centers, chakras, \\nsited along the spinal column from the head to the base of  \\nthe spine. If they are blocked, illness results. \\nUS_036-039_India.indd   37 26/02/16   4:42 pm\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\Encyclopedia Of Herbal Medicine_2.pdf', 'page': 39}, page_content='38\\nThe developmenT  of herbal medicine\\ntemperament, and susceptibility to illnesses are largely governed by the \\npredominant dosha. In this way we inherit our basic constitution, called  \\nthe prakruti, which remains unaltered throughout our lives.  \\n The first requirement for health in Ayurveda is a proper balance of the \\ndoshas. If the balance is upset, illness, ryadhi, results. The disruption may  \\nbe manifested in physical discomfort and pain, or in mental and emotional \\nsuffering, including jealousy, anger, fear, and sorrow. While our balance of \\ndoshas influences vulnerability to certain kinds of illness, the principles do \\nnot work in a vacuum.\\n The effect our lifestyle has on our prakruti—vakruti—has a strong effect \\non overall health, and it may easily disrupt dosha balance.\\n Illness may also result if the flow of energy, prana, around the body  \\nis interrupted. The flow is relayed via the seven chakras (psychic energy \\ncenters), which are situated at various points along the spinal column, \\nfrom the crown of the head to the tailbone. If the energy flowing between \\nthese centers is blocked, the likelihood of ill health increases.\\nVisiting an Ayurvedic Practitioner\\nAn Ayurvedic practitioner first carefully assesses prakruti and vakruti—\\nconstitution and lifestyle. This involves taking a detailed case history and \\ncarefully examining the body, paying attention to the build, the lines  \\nin the face and hands, and skin and hair type—all of which point to  \\nmore profound aspects of the patient’s condition. However, the main \\nfoundations on which diagnosis rests are the appearance of the tongue, \\nand the pulse rate. In these respects, Ayurveda has much in common with \\nChinese and Tibetan medicine, in which these two indicators are also  \\nof the greatest importance. A very complex technique for taking the \\npatient’s pulse has been developed by Ayurvedic practitioners, requiring \\nmany years’ experience.\\n When a dosha imbalance has been diagnosed, medical treatment and \\nlifestyle advice are provided. The first step is eliminating toxins, and the \\nmain cleansing and rejuvenation program, known as panchakarma, \\nincludes therapeutic vomiting, purging, enemas, nasal administration of \\nmedication, and purification of the blood.\\nAttributes of Remedies\\nSubsequent treatments fall into three main categories: medicines  \\nfrom natural sources, dietary regimens, and behavioral modifications. \\nMedicines, foods, and lifestyle activities are all classified according to their \\neffect on the three doshas. For instance, a health problem associated with \\nan excess of kapha, the water principle, is characterized by congestion, \\nexcess weight, fluid retention, and lethargy. The practitioner would \\nprescribe the consumption of warm, dry, light foods, because the quality \\nof kapha is cool and damp. Avoidance of cold damp foods (such as \\nwheat, sugar, and milk products), which increase kapha, would also be \\nadvised. Herbal remedies would include warming spices such as ginger \\n(Zingiber officinale, p. 155) and cayenne (Capsicum frutescens, p. 74), as \\nwell as bitters such as turmeric ( Curcuma longa, p. 90).\\n The specific choice of herbal remedy depends on its “quality” or \\n“energy,” which Ayurveda determines according to twenty attributes \\n(vimshati guna) such as hot, cold, wet, dry, heavy, or light. Ayurveda  \\nalso classifies remedies according to six tastes—sweet, sour, salty, bitter, \\npungent, and astringent.

Today, Ayurveda flourishes side by \\nside with Unani Tibb and Western conventional medicine and is actively \\nencouraged by the Indian government as an inexpensive alternative to \\nWestern drugs. In recent years, Ayurveda has attracted increasing attention \\nfrom medical scientists in the West and in Japan, and the World Health \\nOrganization has resolved to promote its practice in developing countries.\\n Ayurveda’s value lies in the fact that it is not a medical science dealing \\nsolely with treatment of disease.

The Communist Revolution in \\n1949 helped swell the number of plants used in TCM, because herbs that \\nhad previously only been employed in folk medicine were incorporated \\ninto the tradition.\\n As the herbal tradition developed within TCM, the taste and other \\ncharacteristics of herbs became closely linked with their therapeutic uses. \\nThe Divine Husbandman’s Classic (Shen’nong Bencaojing, 1st century ce) lists \\n252 herbal medicines specifying their tastes and “temperatures,” and today, \\nChinese herbalists still relate the taste and temperature of an herb directly  \\nto its therapeutic use. Sweet-tasting \\nherbs such as ginseng (Panax ginseng, \\np. 118) are prescribed to tone, \\nharmonize, and moisten, while bitter- \\ntasting herbs such as dan shen (Salvia \\nmiltiorrhiza, p. 130) are employed  \\nto drain and dry excess “dampness.” \\nHot-tasting herbs are used for \\ntreating “cold” conditions and vice \\nversa. Together, an herb’s taste and \\ntemperature link it to specific types \\nof illness. For example, Baical skullcap \\n(Scutellaria baicalensis, p. 134), which \\nis bitter-tasting and “cold,” is a drying, cooling herb for conditions such as \\nfever and irritability, brought on by patterns of excess heat.\\nTaking Medicines\\nThe Chinese tradition relies heavily on formulas, which are set mixtures \\nof herbs that have proven effectiveness as tonics or remedies for specific \\nillnesses. Many are available over the counter and are used by millions of \\npeople every day in China and around the world. Chinese herbalists \\noften take a formula as a starting point and then add other herbs to the \\nmixture. There are hundreds of formulas, one of the most famous being \\n“Four Things Soup,” a tonic given to regulate the menstrual cycle and \\ntone the reproductive system. It consists of dong quai (Angelica sinensis,  \\np. 63), rehmannia (Rehmannia glutinosa, p. 125), chuang xiong (Ligusticum \\nwallachii), and white peony (Paeonia lactiflora, p. 117).\\n Chinese herbal medicine uses tinctures or alcoholic extracts of herbs, \\nbut only infrequently. Generally, patients are given mixtures of roots and \\nbark to take as decoctions two or three times a day.\\nThe Chinese Influence in Japan & Korea\\nJapan and Korea have been strongly influenced by Chinese medical  \\nideas and practices.

Direct Chinese influence on Japanese \\nmedicine, which was practiced for the most \\npart by the monks, continued for 1,000 \\nyears. In the 16th century, Japan started \\nto assert its cultural identity, and kampoh \\ndeveloped its own characteristic traits, \\nemphasizing the Japanese ideals of \\nsimplicity and naturalness. However, \\ncertain Chinese concepts, such as \\nyin and yang and ki (qi), continued  \\nto have a central role.\\n In 1868, the Japanese embraced \\nWestern conventional medicine. \\nFormal training in kampoh officially \\nceased in 1885, but a few committed \\npractitioners passed their knowledge \\non to younger generations, keeping \\nthe tradition alive. In the last 40 years \\nthe number of medical practitioners who use kampoh within their \\npractice has greatly increased. Many Japanese medical schools now \\ninclude training in kampoh as part of the curriculum. \\n Korean herbal medicine is very similar to mainstream Chinese herbal \\nmedicine, and almost all the Chinese herbs are used in Korea. Ginseng \\n(Panax ginseng, p. 118) has been cultivated in Korea for home use and \\nexport since 1300.\\nImportance of Chinese Herbal Medicine\\nSince 1949 when the Communists gained control, the herbal tradition  \\nhas flourished in China (see p. 29) and today it is recognized as a valid \\nmedical system, available to the Chinese on an equal footing with \\nconventional Western medicine. As is often the case elsewhere, herbs \\nseem to be used mainly for chronic conditions, while Western medicine  \\nis more frequently employed for serious acute illness.\\n Chinese herbal medicine, however, is not just of significance in China \\nand the surrounding regions, but is practiced by trained practitioners in \\nevery continent and, in some countries, now has official government \\nrecognition. For example, there has been a traditional Chinese medicine \\nhospital in Paris since 1996, and in 2013 the French government agreed  \\nto open three new traditional Chinese medicine hospital centers. Herbal \\nmedicine is now taught in 34 Chinese universities. This development (and \\nthe massive input of resources involved) has helped revitalize herbal \\nmedicine around the world over the past 30 to 40 years. \\n The impact of these developments has not been confined solely  \\nto those taking herbal medicines—whether in China or elsewhere.  \\nIn 2015 Dr. Tu Y ouyou, a researcher trained in traditional Chinese \\nmedicine and conventional medicine, was awarded the Nobel Prize  \\nfor medicine for her lifelong study of sweet Annie ( Artemisia annua,  \\np. 67) and its key active constituent artemisinin.

Herbs widely used  \\nin the Middle East, such as myrrh (Commiphora molmol, p. 85), originally  \\ncame from Somalia and the Horn of Africa. From the 5th century ce  \\nto the 13th century, Arab physicians were at the forefront of medical \\nadvancement, and in the 8th century, the spread of Arabic culture across \\nnorthern Africa had an influence on North African medicine that lasts  \\nto this day. In the mid-13th century, the botanist Ibn El Beitar published  \\na Materia Medica that considerably increased the range of North African \\nplant medicines in common use.\\nAncient Beliefs & Indigenous Herbs\\nIn the more remote areas of Africa, nomadic peoples, such as the Berber \\nof Morocco and the Topnaar of Namibia, have herbal traditions that \\nremain largely unaffected by changes in medicine in the world at large.  \\nFor these peoples, healing is linked to a magical world in which spirits \\ninfluence illness and death. In Berber culture, possession by a djinn (spirit)  \\nis a major cause of sickness, and herbs with “magical” properties are given \\nto restore health. If the patient fails to recover, their condition is likely to \\nbe attributed to a curse or to the “evil eye.”\\n The Topnaar formerly depended completely on their environment for \\nmedicines, using the few medicinal plants that grow in such harsh and arid \\nconditions. Although they are now heavily influenced by the Western way  \\nof life and have lost much of their plant lore, they continue to employ many \\nindigenous plants medicinally.

It is a tonic \\nand restorative  \\nfor the nerves  \\nand digestion.\\nThe cradle of the oldest continuous culture on earth, Australia is also  \\nthe home of an ancient herbal tradition. The Aborigines, believed to  \\nhave settled in Australia over 60,000 years ago, developed a sophisticated \\nempirical understanding of indigenous plants, many of which, such as \\neucalyptus (Eucalpytus globulus, p. 96), are unique to Australia. While \\nmuch of this knowledge has vanished with its keepers, there is currently  \\na high level of interest in native herbal traditions.\\nAboriginal Herbal Medicine\\nThe Aborigines probably had a more robust health than the early European \\nsettlers who displaced them. They had very different ideas of health, disease, \\nand illness, in which the influence of the spirit world played a major role. In \\ncommon with other hunter-gatherer societies, the Aborigines devoted \\nmuch time to ritual, which reinforced the sense of place and purpose in the \\nlives of each individual. They used healing plants and the laying on of hands  \\nin a complex weave of culture and medicine.\\n The influx of Europeans in the 18th century was disastrous for  \\nthe Aborigines. They were exploited and driven off the land, and their \\npopulation was decimated by killings and infectious Western diseases.  \\nNot only did the Europeans fail to discern any value in native customs,  \\nbut much of the orally based herbal tradition was lost through death  \\nof the elders and the dispersal of tribal groupings.\\n Nevertheless, a little is known of Aboriginal medicine. Aromatic herbs, \\nsuch as eucalpytus, were crushed and inhaled to treat many common \\nillnesses, including respiratory diseases such as flu. Without metal technology, \\nwater could not be boiled, but decoctions were made by heating water \\nwith hot stones. These were drunk or applied externally. Skin eruptions, \\nsuch as boils and scabies, were common and were treated with acacia \\n(Acacia spp., p. 158), while acute diarrhea was treated with eucalyptus or \\nkino (Pterocarpus marsupium, p. 258). In Queensland, fever bark (Alstonia  \\nspp., p. 165) was used to treat fevers.\\nIndigenous & Foreign Herbs\\nOver the past 200 years, many native Australian plants have become \\npopular around the world. Research into fever bark resulted in the \\ndiscovery of the alkaloid reserpine, which markedly lowers blood pressure. \\nThe substance is now prescribed by herbalists and conventional practi-\\ntioners alike.

Likewise, native American medicinal plants—such as corn, cocoa, \\ncayenne, and sunflower—were introduced to Europe, Asia, and Africa. \\nThis trade of species was an important part of the interplay between the \\nOld and New Worlds’ herbal traditions.\\nHerbal Traditions in Central America\\nHerbal medicine is commonly practiced in rural areas of Central America, \\nespecially in Guatemala and Mexico. In the Mexican tradition, loss of \\n“balance” between hot and cold elements within the body is thought to \\nbe the underlying cause of illness, and the healer’s art is to restore balance \\nand vitality. \\n Mexican herbal medicine is not a static tradition, but has evolved \\nfrom a shifting blend of Aztec, Mayan, and Spanish influences. Long \\nbefore Hernando Cortez and his conquistadors came ashore in 1519, \\nthe Mayan and Aztec cultures had a well-developed understanding of \\nplant medicines. The Badianus Manuscript, the first American herbal \\n(written by an Aztec, Martin de la Cruz, in 1552), lists the medicinal \\nuses of 251 Mexican species. They include damiana (Turnera diffusa,  \\np. 144), taken by the Maya as an aphrodisiac, and mesquite (Prosopis \\njuliflora), used by the Aztecs as an eye lotion. Both species are still used \\nmedicinally, alongside European herbs such as pennyroyal (Mentha \\npulegium, p. 235) and thyme (Thymus vulgaris, p. 143). It is thought that \\napproximately 65 percent of the plants used today by traditional \\nMexican herbalists originated in Europe.\\n In other Central American countries efforts are being made to \\nencourage people to use herbal medicine as the first line of treatment for \\nillness. Projects in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua, for example, are \\nteaching women how to use local herbs within their communities, while in \\nCuba doctors routinely prescribe medicinal herbs to make up for the \\nscarcity of conventional medicines.\\nCaribbean Herbal Medicine\\nThroughout the Caribbean, domestic herbal medicine remains popular. \\nSome of the widely used herbs include fever grass or lemon grass \\n(Cymbopogon citratus, p. 198), which, as its name suggests, is used to treat \\nfevers, and kerala (Momordica charantia, p. 236), a creeping vine that is \\nprized as a “cure-all” on many of the islands.

Shamanistic societies from Siberia to the Amazon \\nbelieve that, in serious illness, the soul of the sick person has been taken \\nover by malign forces. The shaman’s role is to heal both the physical and \\nthe spiritual dimension of the illness. The patient cannot be truly cured \\nuntil his or her soul has been freed from evil spirits. Shamanistic ceremonies \\nand rites to heal the sick person’s spirit include dancing, chanting, drumming, \\nplaying games, and the stirring of ashes or sprinkling of water.

The settlers relied largely on imported \\nherbal medicines, or on European plants hardy enough to grow in eastern \\nNorth America.\\n As time went by, however, the settlers’ increased contact with indigenous \\npeoples in the frontier regions fostered a healthy respect for their healing \\nskills. Sometimes settlers adopted not just the plants but the harvesting and \\ntherapeutic methods as well. Joseph Doddridge, in Notes on the Settlement \\nand Indian Wars (1876), relates that butternut bark (Juglans cinerea, p. 224) \\nwas peeled downward if it was to be used as a purgative (acting \\n“downward” by purging the bowels), and upward for use as an emetic \\n(acting “upward” by provoking vomiting).\\n The types of healing regimens practiced by Native Americans \\neventually gained widespread popularity. Toward the end of the 18th \\ncentury, Samuel Thomson (1769–1843) developed a simple therapeutic \\nregimen based on Native American herbal practice. Thomson never \\nacknowledged the debt, but it is clearly evident—from the use of emetics, \\npurgatives, and stimulants, to the central role of sweating and vapor baths \\n(based in part on Native American sweat lodges), to the deep knowledge \\nof American medicinal plants. Thomson considered that “all disease is \\ncaused by cold” and his system worked well for those with a robust health \\nstruck down by infection or injury. The two main herbs in his system—\\ncayenne, a stimulating herb, and lobelia, an emetic, relaxant, and \\nstimulant—act to raise body temperature and dilate the blood vessels. \\nT aking these plants helps to increase resistance to infection and speeds the \\nhealing of wounds.\\nEclecticism & Its Influence\\nThe fertile marriage between Native American and Western herbal \\nmedicine led to the establishment of more sophisticated herbal systems, \\nsuch as Eclecticism, founded by Dr. Wooster Beech (1794–1868) in the \\n1830s. Beech studied both herbal and conventional medicine and tried  \\nto combine the new scientific knowledge of \\nphysiology and pathology with the best of the \\nherbal tradition. Beech rejected Thomson’s \\ntheories as being overly simplistic, and aimed  \\nto use the lowest dosages possible to achieve \\ngood results. His approach was so successful \\nthat at Eclecticism’s height in 1909, over \\n8,000 members were in practice, all  \\nwith recognized medical qualifications. \\nAnother significant medical movement, \\ninspired by Thomson’s regimen and \\ninfluenced by the Eclectics, was \\nPhysiomedicalism. Using many  \\nherbs, these practitioners sought  \\nSamuel Thomson, who inspired  \\nthe 19th-century Physiomedicalists,  \\nadvocated Native American remedies.\\nAvocado bark\\nUS_048-051_North_America.indd   50 26/02/16   4:43 pm'),\n",

To this day, British herbalists still use  \\na far wider variety of North American medicinal herbs than do their \\nEuropean counterparts.\\nNorth American Herbal Medicine Today\\nIn the U.S., herbal medicine went into steep decline after 1907 because  \\nof the government’s decision to limit financial support for herbal medical \\ntraining at conventional medical schools. Since that time, herbal medicine  \\nin both the U.S. and Canada has existed mostly on the fringes of \\nconventional health care. In some U.S. states, it is illegal to practice herbal \\nmedicine without medical qualifications, but courses in herbalism are not \\noffered at medical schools.\\n With the passing of liberal legislation in 1994, use of herbal medicine \\nin the U.S. exploded and sales of St. John’s wort ( Hypericum perforatum,  \\np. 106)—the most extreme example—are thought to have increased  \\nby 3,900 percent between 1995 and 1997. Such growth could not be \\nsustained, and led to lower-quality herbal products being sold over the \\ncounter. The American Botanical Council has been at the forefront of the \\ncampaign to raise quality standards of herbal medicines, and many bona \\nfide herbal manufacturers have signed up to their Botanical Adulterants \\nprogram. At the same time, greater resources are being put into \\nresearching herbal medicines, for example through the U.S. National Center \\nfor Complementary and Integrative Health, which \\nhas so far funded over 15 clinical trials into herbs \\nsuch as garlic (Allium sativum, p. 59) and saw \\npalmetto (Serenoa repens, p. 136).\\n Over the past 20 years, North Americans have \\nbecome increasingly savvy about herbal medicines \\nand their role in maintaining well-being and \\ntreating ill health.

Quinine, produced from this plant, became the \\nmost effective treatment for malaria for nearly 300 years and is still widely \\nused as a tonic, bitter, and muscle relaxant. Other important plants \\noriginating in South America include the potato (Solanum tuberosum,  \\np. 271), which was cultivated in over 60 different varieties by the Inca. Its \\nuses are wide-ranging, but it is particularly effective as a poultice for skin \\nconditions.

It is propagated \\nfrom seed in autumn or spring. Leaves \\nare harvested in summer, the bark \\nand seeds in autumn. \\nRelated Species\\nDo not use Ohio Buckeye (A. glabra) \\nas it is toxic if taken internally.\\nKey Constituents\\n■ Triterpenoid saponins, including  \\n about 5% aescin, a complex  \\n mixture of glycosides\\n■ Polysaccharides (about 50%)\\n■ Coumarins, including aesculin \\n■ Flavonoids\\n■ Tannins, including proanthocyanidins\\n■ Fixed oil (2–3%)\\nKey Actions\\n■ Venous tonic\\n■ Astringent\\n■ Anti-inflammatory\\n■ Antioxidant\\n■ Reduces fluid retention\\nResearch\\n■ Clinical trials Numerous trials \\nhave confirmed horse chestnut’s value \\nas a medicine in venous problems \\nsuch as varicose veins, venous ulcers, \\nhemorrhoids, and frostbite. In one \\nLondon-based study, published in \\n1996, horsechestnut extract was \\nshown to be as effective in treating \\nvaricose veins as compression \\nstockings.

The review con-\\ncluded that horse chestnut extract \\nwas a safe and effective short-term \\ntreatment for this problem. \\nTraditional &  \\nCurrent Uses\\n■ Circulatory system Although \\nhorse chestnut has a beneficial  \\neffect on the heart and arteries, it  \\nis primarily a remedy for the veins.  \\nIt helps improve the tone of the  \\nvein walls, which when slack or \\ndistended result in varicose veins, \\npiles, and similar problems. It also \\nreduces edema (fluid retention) \\ncaused by fluid leaking from \\ndistended veins, and increases the \\npermeability of the capillaries, \\nallowing excess fluid to drain back \\ninto the circulatory system. Horse \\nchestnut is taken internally for leg \\nulcers, varicose veins, piles, and \\nfrostbite, and applied locally as a \\nlotion, gel, or ointment. A decoction \\nof the bark or leaf can be used as an \\nastringent lotion for varicose veins. \\n■ Rheumatism In France, an oil \\nextracted from the seeds has  \\nParts Used\\nKey Preparations & Their Uses\\nbeen used as a topical application  \\nfor rheumatism. \\n■ Chest remedy Horse chestnut \\nmakes a serviceable chest remedy and \\nin Turkey has been used to treat chest \\ncomplaints in horses.

This plant has  \\nbeen used to treat asthma but is \\nmainly taken as a diuretic and to  \\ntreat psoriasis.\\nKey Constituents\\n■ Furochromones including  \\n khellin (1%) and visnagin\\n■ Coumarins\\n■ Flavonoids\\n■ Volatile oil\\n■ Phytosterols\\nKey Actions\\n■ Antispasmodic\\n■ Antiasthmatic\\n■ Relaxant\\nResearch\\n■ Strong antispasmodic  \\nResearch by a pharmacologist \\nworking in Egypt in 1946 revealed \\nthat visnaga (in particular its \\nconstituents khellin and visnagin)  \\nhas a powerful antispasmodic action \\non the smaller bronchial muscles,  \\nthe coronary arteries that supply \\nblood to the heart, and on the \\nurinary tubules. Visnaga’s ability  \\nto relax the small bronchi lasts  \\nfor up to 6 hours, and the plant  \\nhas practically no side effects.\\n■ Khellin Intal, an asthma drug  \\nwidely used in conventional medicine, \\nis derived chemically from khellin. \\nTraditional &  \\nCurrent Uses\\n■ Kidney stones Visnaga is a \\ntraditional Egyptian remedy for \\nkidney stones. It was mentioned  \\nin the Ebers papyrus of Egypt  \\n(c. 1500 bce) and is still used  \\nthere to relieve kidney stones.  \\nBy relaxing the muscles of the  \\nureter, visnaga reduces the pain \\ncaused by the trapped stone  \\nand helps ease the stone down  \\ninto the bladder. \\n■ Asthma remedy Following \\nresearch into its antispasmodic \\nproperties, visnaga is now given  \\nfor asthma, and is safe even for \\nchildren to take. Although it does  \\nnot always relieve acute asthma \\nattacks, it does help to prevent  \\ntheir recurrence. \\n■ Other respiratory conditions \\nVisnaga is an effective remedy  \\nfor various respiratory problems, \\nincluding bronchitis, emphysema,  \\nand whooping cough. \\n■ Circulatory herb By  \\nrelaxing the coronary arteries,  \\nvisnaga helps to improve blood \\nsupply to the heart muscle and \\nthereby eases angina. Visnaga  \\ndoes not, however, reduce  \\nblood pressure.\\nParts Used\\nKey Preparations & Their Uses\\n■ Dental hygiene In Andalusia  \\nin Spain, the largest and best-quality \\nvisnaga seeds were employed to clean \\nthe teeth. The high value given to the \\nherb in general was reflected in the \\nsaying: “Oro, plata, visnaga, o nada!” \\n(Gold, silver, visnaga, or nothing!).\\nVisnaga, with its aromatic, bitter scent and flavor, has \\ngreater medicinal than culinary value. It is an effective \\nmuscle relaxant and has been used for many centuries  \\nto alleviate the excruciating pain of kidney stones.

Some of  \\nits constituents are employed in conventional medicine,  \\nfor example to dilate the pupils for eye examinations  \\nand as an anesthetic. In herbal medicine, deadly  \\nnightshade is mainly prescribed to relieve intestinal  \\ncolic and to treat peptic ulcers.\\nHabitat & Cultivation\\nDeadly nightshade is native to \\nEurope, western Asia, and northern \\nAfrica, and is now cultivated \\nworldwide. It thrives in chalky soils,  \\nin woods, and in open areas. The \\nleaves are harvested in summer, and \\nthe root is collected from the first \\nyear onward in autumn.\\nRelated Species\\nMany of the Solanaceae family  \\nare powerful medicines, including \\neggplant (Solanum melongena,  \\np. 270), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum,  \\np. 240), and henbane (Hyoscyamus \\nniger, p. 220).\\nKey Constituents\\n■ Tropane alkaloids (up to 0.6%),  \\n including hyoscyamine and atropine\\n■ Flavonoids\\n■ Coumarins\\n■ Volatile bases (nicotine)\\nKey Actions\\n■ Smooth muscle antispasmodic\\n■ Narcotic\\n■ Reduces sweating\\n■ Sedative\\nResearch\\n■ Tropane alkaloids, The action  \\nof the tropane alkaloids is well \\nunderstood. They inhibit the \\nparasympathetic nervous system, \\nwhich controls involuntary bodily \\nactivities. This reduces saliva; gastric, \\nintestinal, and bronchial secretions;  \\nas well as the activity of the urinary \\ntubules, bladder, and intestines. \\nTropane alkaloids also increase  \\nheart rate and dilate the pupils. \\nTraditional &  \\nCurrent Uses\\n■ Folklore Deadly nightshade was \\nbelieved to help witches fly. Its other \\nname “belladonna” (beautiful woman) \\nis thought to refer to its use by Italian \\nwomen to dilate the pupils of their \\neyes, making them more attractive. \\n■ Relaxant Deadly nightshade  \\nhas been used in the same way \\nthroughout history. It is prescribed  \\nto relax distended organs, especially \\nthe stomach and intestines, relieving \\nintestinal colic and pain. It helps  \\npeptic ulcers by reducing gastric  \\nacid production, and it relaxes  \\nspasms of the urinary tubules. \\n■ Parkinson’s disease The herb \\ncan be used to treat the symptoms \\nof Parkinson’s disease, reducing \\ntremors and rigidity, and improving \\nspeech and mobility. \\n■ Anesthetic muscle-relaxant \\nproperties of deadly nightshade make \\nit useful in conventional medicine as \\nan anesthetic, particularly when \\ndigestive or bronchial secretions \\nneed to be kept to a minimum. \\nDeadly nightshade\\nA perennial with large \\nleaves and black \\nberries, growing to  \\n5 ft (1.5 m).\\nDeadly nightshade  produces unmistakable \\ncherry-sized, glossy black berries  \\nin autumn.\\nParts Used\\nKey Preparations & Their Uses\\nLeaves are harvested in early summer.  \\nThey have a weaker action than the root,  \\nand are more commonly used.\\nRoot is collected  \\nin autumn.\\n RCautions T ake only if prescribed by a medical herbalist or doctor.  \\nDeadly nightshade can be fatal if taken at the wrong dosage.\\nDried leaves\\nDried root Fresh root\\nFresh leaves\\nLeaves, like the root,  \\nhave relaxant \\nproperties.\\nUS_068-069_Astragalus_Atropa.indd   69 26/02/16   3:58 pm\\n'),\n",

The sennosides irritate the \\nlining of the large intestine, causing \\nthe muscles to contract strongly, \\nresulting in a bowel movement about \\n10 hours after the dose is taken.  \\nThe sennosides also stop fluid being \\nabsorbed from the large intestine, \\nhelping to keep the stool soft. \\nTraditional &  \\nCurrent Uses\\n■ Early records The herb was  \\nfirst used medicinally by Arabian \\nphysicians in the 9th century ce. \\n■ Constipation Senna has always \\nbeen specifically used for constipation. \\nIt is particularly appropriate when a \\nsoft stool is required, for example in \\ncases of anal fissure. Senna is a good \\nshort-term laxative but should not  \\nbe taken for more than 10 days as  \\nthis leads to weakening of the large \\nintestine muscles.\\n■ Cathartic As a cathartic (very \\nstrong laxative), senna can cause \\ncramping and colic, and is therefore \\nnormally taken with aromatic, \\ncarminative herbs that relax the \\nintestinal muscles. \\nSelf-help Use\\n■ Constipation, p. 307. \\nSenna \\nA small perennial \\nshrub growing to  \\n3 ft (1 m), with a \\nstraight, woody stem \\nand yellow flowers.\\nSenna shrubs have pairs of lance- \\nshaped leaflets arranged on either side  \\nof a central stem.\\nParts Used\\nKey Preparations & Their Uses\\nDried leaves\\nFresh leaves\\nPods are milder in effect than \\nthe leaves.

Asiaticoside, in \\nparticular, has been shown to speed \\nup collagen formation and the laying \\ndown of new blood vessels. This \\nhealing effect extends to the blood \\nvessels, so that gotu kola extracts aid \\nvenous repair, notably in chronic \\nvenous insufficiency, a condition that \\nincludes symptoms such as leg \\nswelling and varicose veins. Recent \\nU.S. research has investigated the \\neffectiveness of high-strength \\nextracts to help in diabetic neuropathy \\n(nerve pain due to poor circulation) \\nwith signs of positive benefit.\\n■ Brain function In the last 10 \\nyears, research has focused on gotu \\nkola’s ability to relieve anxiety and \\nsupport healthy brain function.  \\nA Thai clinical trial in 2008 found that \\ngotu kola extract improved attention, \\nworking memory, alertness, and \\nmood in 28 healthy volunteers with \\nan average age of 65.

Traditionally used to treat colds, flu,  \\nand digestive problems, cinnamon is now commonly \\ntaken to help stabilize blood-sugar levels.\\n QCautions Occasionally causes allergic reaction; excessive doses may cause  \\nlow blood sugar; do not take essential oil internally.\\n■ Convalescence Cinnamon is a \\ngentle-acting herb that helps to \\nsupport both digestion and circulation. \\nIt is used specifically in the treatment \\nof debility and in convalescence. \\n■ Gynecological remedy  \\nIt can help relieve period cramps \\nand might have a normalizing effect \\non menstrual bleeding—controlling \\nheavy bleeding but stimulating flow \\nwhere it is light. It is valuable in the \\ntreatment of PCOS (polycystic \\novary syndrome) as it helps to \\nreduce insulin levels and stabilize \\nestrogen levels. \\n■ Insulin resistance It has a \\ndistinct role to play in promoting \\nbetter blood glucose levels and in \\npreventing insulin resistance—the \\nimpaired uptake of sugar by cells that \\nis a warning sign of diabetes. One \\nsuggestion, as part of a wider regimen \\nfor diabetes and metabolic syndrome, \\nis to take 3 tsp of cinnamon powder a \\nday for 4 months. \\n■ Gastrointestinal problems  \\nIt has always been used as a warming \\nand soothing remedy for digestion, \\naiding in nausea, indigestion,  \\nand flatulence, as well as colic and \\ndiarrhea. Its antifungal activity means \\nthat it can be of value in gut dysbiosis \\n(disordered gut bacteria).\\nSelf-help Use\\n■ Colds, p. 311.\\nPowder take up to 3 tsp a day to support stable blood-sugar levels.\\nTincture To make, infuse the herb in alcohol (see p. 292). For flatulence,  \\ntake 20 drops with water up to 4 times a day.\\nUS_080-081_Cinchona_Cinnamomum.indd   81 26/02/16   3:58 pm\\n'),\n",

It \\nreduces the production within the \\nbody of oxalates, substances that can \\nprecipitate in the kidneys and bladder \\nto form stones. The herb also seems \\nto reduce the rate at which stone-\\nforming constituents within the urine  \\nare deposited in the kidneys.\\n■ Urinary system Indian research \\nin the 1980s and 1990s points to \\nvaruna being valuable in the \\ntreatment of urinary tract infections \\nand bladder problems caused by an \\nenlarged prostate gland.

The \\nbark is also used to treat fevers, \\ngastritis, and vomiting, as well as \\nsnake bite. The fresh leaves, bruised \\nand mixed with vinegar, relieve sore \\nand inflamed joints. \\n■ Kidney stones Today, varuna is \\nbeginning to be used in the West, as \\nwell as in India, in the prevention and \\ntreatment of kidney stones. It is given \\nto people who are prone to develop \\nkidney stones, reducing the tendency \\nto stone formation. It is also prescribed \\nfor people who already have small \\nstones.

The aerial parts are harvested  \\nin early autumn, when the seed \\ncapsules are most numerous, and  \\nare carefully dried. \\nRelated Species\\nAt least 4 other Lobelia species were \\ntraditionally used by Native Americans. \\nOne, great lobelia (L. siphilitica), as its \\nLatin name suggests, was credited  \\nby Native Americans and European \\nsettlers with the power to cure \\nsyphilis. Chinese lobelia (ban bian \\nlian, L. chinensis) is used in Chinese  \\nherbal medicine mainly as a diuretic \\nand for snake bite. \\nKey Constituents\\n■ Piperidine alkaloids (6%)— \\n principally lobeline, but  \\n many others present\\n■ Carboxylic acids\\nKey Actions\\n■ Respiratory stimulant \\n■ Antispasmodic \\n■ Expectorant \\n■ Induces vomiting \\n■ Increases sweating\\nTraditional &  \\nCurrent Uses\\n■ Native American remedy \\nLobelia was a traditional Native \\nAmerican remedy with a wide range \\nof applications. Its use was later \\nchampioned by the American \\nherbalist Samuel Thomson (1769–\\n1843), who made the herb the \\nmainstay of his therapeutic system \\n(see p. 27). He mainly used it to \\ninduce vomiting.\\n■ Therapeutic properties The \\nwhole herb is strongly antispasmodic. \\nThe constituent lobeline stimulates \\nthe respiratory center within the \\nbrain stem, producing stronger  \\nand deeper breathing. Laboratory \\ninvestigations during the 1990s \\nsuggest that lobeline has \\nantidepressant activity.\\n■ Respiratory problems  \\nA powerful antispasmodic and \\nrespiratory stimulant, lobelia is \\nvaluable for asthma, particularly \\nbronchial asthma, and chronic \\nbronchitis. The herb helps to relax \\nthe muscles of the smaller bronchial \\ntubes, thereby opening the airways, \\nstimulating breathing, and promoting \\nthe coughing up of phlegm. In the \\nAnglo-American herbal tradition, \\nlobelia has always been combined \\nwith cayenne (Capsicum frutescens,  \\np. 74); the heating, stimulant action \\nhelps to push blood into areas that \\nlobelia has relaxed. \\n■ External applications Some \\nconstituents, especially lobeline, \\nbreak down rapidly in the body, and \\nlobelia is often most effective applied \\nexternally. Its antispasmodic action \\nhelps to relax muscles, particularly \\nsmooth muscle, making it useful for \\nsprains, and back problems where \\nmuscle tension is a key factor.

In common with other Lobelia \\nspecies, it was a traditional Native American remedy  \\nfor many conditions. It was used as a “puke weed” to \\ninduce vomiting, as a remedy for worms and venereal \\ndisease, and as an expectorant.

Its root is used \\nmedicinally to relieve pain.\\nHabitat & Cultivation\\nKava is an indigenous Polynesian vine \\nand grows throughout the Pacific \\nIslands as far east as Hawaii. It is \\ncultivated commercially in parts  \\nof the U.S. and in Australia. Kava is \\npropagated from runners in late winter \\nor early spring and is usually grown on \\nframes. It needs well-drained, stony soil \\nand a shady position. The root is \\nharvested at any time of year.\\nRelated Species\\nThe closely related P. sanctum is native \\nto Mexico. It is similar to kava in many \\nways; for example, it also contains  \\nkava lactones and is traditionally taken \\nas a stimulant. Other related species \\ninclude matico, betel, cubeb, and \\npepper (P. angustifolia, P. betle,  \\nP. cubeba and P. nigrum, pp. 249–250).\\nKey Constituents\\n■ Resin containing kava  \\n lactones, including kawain\\n■ Piperidine alkaloid  \\n (pipermethysticine)\\nKey Actions\\n■ Tonic\\n■ Reduces anxiety\\n■ Urinary antiseptic\\n■ Analgesic\\n■ Induces sleep\\nKava has major ritual and cultural significance among  \\nthe peoples of the Pacific Islands, where it is as much a \\npart of daily social life as coffee is in the West. At  \\nmodest doses, kava is calming and tranquilizing.  \\nAt large doses, it leads to intoxication and euphoria,  \\nthough without a hangover the next day. It has a hot,  \\nslightly aromatic and bitter taste and leaves the mouth \\nfeeling slightly numb. \\nParts Used Key Preparations & Their Uses\\nResearch\\n■ German ban In 2002, German \\nregulators banned kava products  \\ndue to concerns that extracts were \\ntoxic to the liver and had led to  \\n20 deaths. Many other countries \\nfollowed Germany’s example.  \\nThe ban was repealed by the \\nGerman authorities in 2015. Those \\ncampaigning against it had long \\nmaintained that the traditional use of \\nkava, especially water-based extracts \\nof kava, were inherently safe. \\nAustralian regulators had adopted \\nthis approach in 2003 by allowing the \\nsale of water-based extracts of kava. \\nA rigorous reexamination of the 20 \\nfatal cases found that only two cases \\ncould in any way be attributed to  \\nthe use of kava.\\n■ Anxiety A 2003 review of kava \\nfound that “compared with placebo, \\nkava extract is an effective \\nsymptomatic treatment for anxiety.” \\nThe authors commented that “few \\nadverse events were reported in the \\nreviewed trials.” Kava is nonaddictive, \\nand clinical evidence suggests it is also  \\na safe and effective treatment for \\nanxiety linked with depression,  \\nfor insomnia, and for pain relief. \\nTraditional &  \\nCurrent Uses\\n■ Traditional aphrodisiac Kava  \\nis valued in the South Sea Islands as a \\ncalming and stimulating intoxicant.  \\nIt produces a euphoric state when \\ntaken in large quantities.\\n■ Relaxing remedy Kava is a safe \\nand proven remedy for anxiety that \\ndoes not cause drowsiness or affect \\nthe ability to operate machinery. It is \\nvaluable for treating muscle tension \\nas well as emotional stress. \\n■ Pain relief With its tonic, \\nstrengthening, and mildly analgesic \\nproperties, kava is a good remedy  \\nfor chronic pain, helping to reduce \\nsensitivity and to relax muscles that \\nare tensed in response to pain.\\n■ Arthritic conditions The \\nanalgesic and cleansing diuretic effect \\nof Kava often makes it a beneficial \\nherb for treating rheumatic and \\narthritic problems such as gout. It \\nhelps to bring relief from pain and  \\nto remove waste products from the \\naffected joint.\\n■ Antiseptic Kava is routinely used \\nby peoples of the South Pacific to \\ntreat infection, especially where pain \\nis a key symptom. In New Guinea,  \\nit is taken to soothe and treat sore \\nthroats and to relieve toothache.  \\nIt makes a valuable urinary antiseptic \\nand will help in treating cystitis, \\nurethritis, urinary frequency, and \\nbladder irritability.\\n■ External uses The herb makes  \\na useful analgesic mouthwash for \\ntreating toothache and mouth ulcers.\\nRoot relieves pain and  \\ncounters urinary infections.\\nDried root\\nTraditionally the root is \\nchewed and fermented \\nwith saliva \\n QCautions Do not exceed recommended dosage or take for more than  \\n2 months at a time.

Given their small size and brown \\ncolor, psyllium husks and seeds have been mistaken for \\nfleas, hence their folk name flea seed. Bland-tasting, they  \\nswell when moistened, and have a jellylike consistency  \\nin the mouth. \\nHabitat & Cultivation\\nThe three species that produce \\npsyllium grow throughout southern \\nEurope, North Africa, and Asia, \\nespecially in India, and are extensively \\ncultivated. They are propagated from \\nseed in spring and require plenty of \\nsun. The seeds are harvested when \\nripe in late summer and early autumn. \\nRelated Species\\nCommon plantain ( P. major, p. 251) \\nis prescribed for diarrhea and \\nirritable bowel syndrome.

Since then research has \\nshown that bilberries help the eyes to adjust to the dark, \\nand stimulate the part of the retina most involved in \\nseeing clearly, especially in dim or dark conditions.  \\nThere is also the suggestion that bilberry fruit helps  \\nto correct nearsightedness.\\nHabitat & Cultivation\\nBilberry thrives in moist undergrowth \\non moors, hillsides, and heathland, \\nthroughout temperate regions of  \\nthe northern hemisphere—Asia, \\nEurope, and North America. Widely \\ncultivated around the world, bilberry \\nis propagated from seed in autumn, \\nor from cuttings. The leaves are \\ncollected in summer, the fruit  \\nwhen ripe in late summer or  \\nearly autumn.\\nRelated Species\\nOther members of the Ericaceae, \\nsuch as bearberry (Arctostaphyllos \\nuva-ursi, p. 170), cowberry (V. vitis-\\nidaea), and cranberry (V. macrocarpon,  \\np. 280) are used principally as  \\nurinary antiseptics. \\nKey Constituents\\n■ Tannins (approximately 7%)\\n■ Proanthocyanins\\n■ Flavonoids\\n■ Fruit acids\\n■ Phenolic acids\\n■ Pectin\\n■ Vitamin B2, C, and carotene\\nKey Actions\\n■ Circulatory tonic\\n■ Antioxidant\\n■ Anti-inflammatory\\n■ Astringent\\n■ Urinary antiseptic\\nResearch\\n■ Circulation Clinical trials from \\n1964 onward have shown that \\nbilberry fruits protect peripheral \\ncirculation and capillaries.

As the  \\nname “chaste tree” implies, it was thought to reduce  \\nsexual desire, and traditionally it was chewed by monks  \\nto reduce unwanted libido. Research has confirmed that \\nchaste tree has a hormonal action, and today it is used  \\nfor menstrual problems and infertility. \\nHabitat & Cultivation\\nChaste tree is native to the \\nMediterranean region and western \\nAsia. It is cultivated in subtropical \\nareas around the world, and has \\nbecome naturalized in many regions.  \\nIt is grown from seed in spring  \\nor autumn. The ripe berries are \\ncollected in autumn.\\nRelated Species\\nAs a member of the Verbenaceae \\ngenus, chaste tree is a distant  \\nrelative of vervain (Verbena officinalis, \\np. 149) and lemon verbena (Lippia \\ncitriodora, p. 228).\\nKey Constituents\\n■ Volatile oil (cineol) \\n■ Flavonoids (casticin)\\n■ Iridoids (aucubin, agnoside,  \\n eurostoside)\\n■ Diterpenes\\nKey Actions\\n■ Regulates hormones\\n■ Progesterogenic\\n■ Increases breast-milk production\\n■ Aids sleep\\nResearch\\n■ Hormonal properties The \\nberries are thought to induce subtle \\nhormonal effects within the brain, \\nleading to increased levels of the \\nneurotransmitters dopamine and \\nmelatonin. These changes are \\nthought to promote better hormonal \\nregulation of the menstrual cycle, \\nnotably through raised progesterone \\nlevels. In some people, the raised \\nmelatonin levels may aid sleep quality. \\nThe diterpenes are thought to be \\nchiefly responsible for these effects.\\n■ Gynecological problems \\nClinical research by and large \\nsupports the use of chaste tree in \\nmany female hormonal problems, \\nincluding premenstrual syndrome \\n(PMS), irregular menstruation, \\nbreast tenderness, and infertility.  \\nA 2001 clinical trial tested chaste \\nberry against placebo in 178 women \\nwith PMS. After 3 months, those \\ntaking chaste tree had a 50% \\nreduction in symptoms compared  \\nto placebo. \\n■ Sleep aid Since researchers \\nfound that chaste berry increases \\nmelatonin levels, chaste berry has \\nbeen thought of as a possible sleep \\naid. Some small studies indicate that \\nchaste berry might help people with \\ninsomnia due to unhealthy melatonin \\nlevels, such as shift workers or those \\nwho are jet lagged. \\nTraditional  \\n& Current Uses\\n■ Menstrual problems Chaste \\ntree is probably the most used herb \\nin Western herbal medicine for \\nregulating the menstrual cycle.

Often grown as a \\ngarden herb, it is also extensively cultivated for its \\nseed oil.\\nParts Used Aerial parts, flowers, seed oil.\\nConstituents Borage contains mucilage, \\ntannins, and pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which in \\nisolation are toxic to the liver. The seeds contain  \\nup to 24% gamma-linolenic acid.\\nin a poultice, or as an infusion. The flowers \\nencourage sweating and the leaves are diuretic. \\nThe seed oil is particularly rich in polyunsaturated \\nfats, and is superior in this respect to evening \\nprimrose oil (Oenothera biennis, p. 241). Borage \\nseed oil is used to treat premenstrual complaints, \\nrheumatic problems, eczema, and other chronic \\nskin conditions.\\nCautions Due to the presence of toxic \\npyrrolizidine alkaloids, there is uncertainty over \\nborage’s safety as a medicine. It is subject to legal \\nrestrictions in some countries and should not be \\ntaken internally. These restrictions and cautions  \\ndo not apply to borage seed oil.\\nBorage’s attractive blue \\nflowers are traditionally  \\nused to decorate salads.\\nHistory & Folklore The herbalist John Gerard, \\nwriting in 1597, extols borage’s virtues, “A syrup \\nmade of the flowers of borage comforteth  \\nthe heart, purgeth melancholy, and quieteth  \\nthe phreneticke or lunaticke person.” Gerard  \\nalso quotes the old saying, “I, Borage, bring  \\nalways courage.”\\nMedicinal Actions & Uses With its high \\nmucilage content, borage is a demulcent herb  \\nand soothes respiratory problems.

Within the first year,  \\nit produces a greatly enlarged terminal bud  \\nthat develops into the familiar cabbage head  \\nin late summer.\\nHabitat & Cultivation  Wild cabbage is  \\nnative to coasts of the English Channel and the \\nMediterranean. Cultivated varieties are produced \\nworldwide as a vegetable.\\nParts Used Leaves.\\nConstituents Cabbage is rich in vitamins A, B1, \\nB2, and C.\\nHistory & Folklore The wholesome cabbage \\nis one of the oldest vegetables. According to Greek \\nmyth, the plant sprang into existence from the \\nperspiration of Zeus. In a Greek ritual, cabbage was \\ngiven to expectant mothers shortly before birth in \\norder to establish good breast-milk \\nproduction. The Romans used \\ncabbage as an antidote, \\nespecially to alcohol, believing \\nit countered intoxication  \\nand prevented or reduced a \\nhangover. They also used cabbage \\nleaves to cleanse infected wounds. \\nIt is thought to have been cultivated \\nin Britain from around 500 ce. \\nOne traditional method of making a cabbage \\npoultice, still used today, is to cut out the thick \\nmidrib of a leaf and iron it, placing it while still hot \\non the area to be treated.\\nMedicinal Actions & Uses Cabbage’s best-\\nknown medicinal use is as a poultice—the leaves  \\nof the wild or cultivated plant are blanched, crushed,  \\nor chopped, and applied to swellings, tumors, and \\npainful joints. Wild cabbage leaves eaten raw or \\ncooked aid digestion and the breakdown of toxins \\nin the liver—so the Romans’ eating it to ease a \\nhangover was in fact quite justified. Cabbage is also \\ndetoxifying and helpful in the long-term treatment \\nof arthritis. The high vitamin C content of cabbage \\nhas made it useful in the prevention of scurvy.\\nCaution A cabbage poultice may cause blisters  \\nif left on for several hours. \\nBryonia dioica syn.

This \\nconstituent has a strongly disinfectant effect \\nwithin the bladder and urinary tubules.\\nHistory & Folklore  If the “erica” that \\nDioscorides discusses in his 1st century ce Materia \\nMedica is indeed heather, as has been surmised, then \\nthe flowering tips were used in classical times to \\ntreat snake bite. Galen (131–200 ce) wrote of  \\nthe plant’s ability to induce sweating. The rootstock \\nof heather is made into musical pipes, the foliage \\nprovides mattress stuffing, and the flowers produce \\na delicate honey. White heather is considered very \\nlucky, especially in Scotland.\\nMedicinal Actions & Uses Heather is a good \\nurinary antiseptic and diuretic, disinfecting the \\nurinary tract and mildly increasing urine production. \\nBesides its role in treating cystitis and inflammatory \\nbladder conditions, heather has been used to \\ntreat kidney and bladder stones.

A strong brew of tea \\nmay be used to soothe irritated eyelids, \\ninsect stings, swellings, and sunburn, and \\nin an emergency, if nothing better is at \\nhand, tea makes a serviceable treatment \\nfor minor burns. In Ayurvedic medicine tea \\nis considered astringent and a nerve tonic.  \\nThe caffeine in tea may help to relieve \\nheadaches, though less effectively than \\ncoffee (Coffea arabica, p. 192). In light of \\nresearch, green tea is recognized as being a \\nmuch healthier drink than black tea.\\nResearch Green tea’s strong antioxidant \\nactivity is due to polyphenols, which give the \\nleaf potential as a cancer preventative.  \\nThe high intake of green tea in China and \\nJapan is thought to be partly responsible for \\nthe low incidence of cancer in these countries. \\nClinical trials indicate that green tea may help to \\npromote weight loss and treat hepatitis, and \\nthere is the suggestion that it helps to prevent \\ntooth decay.

It \\nis the only plant to contain \\nTHC, one of the main \\npsychoactive \\nconstituents. The \\nseed oil contains \\napproximately 55% \\nlinoleic acid, 20% alpha-\\nlinolenic acid and 1.5% gamma-\\nlinolenic acid.\\nHistory & Folklore  \\nIn ancient Egypt, marijuana was used to treat \\ninflammations of the eye and “to cool the uterus.” \\nFirst records of marijuana’s use in India date back  \\nto about 800 bce, where it is recommended  \\nfor congestion. Famously, Queen Victoria took \\nmarijuana as an analgesic—in the 19th century  \\nthe plant was a standard painkiller for menstrual \\npain and cramps. From 1840 to 1900, over 100 \\npapers were published recommending marijuana \\nas a medicine.\\nMedicinal Actions & Uses In view of its  \\nlong history as a medicinal treatment, it is hardly \\nsurprising that marijuana has, at one time or another, \\nbeen recommended for almost every illness. As \\nan analgesic, it appears to relieve pain with minimal \\nside effects, being particularly helpful for cancer and \\nAIDS patients undergoing chemotherapy. For those \\nsuffering from multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, and \\nother muscular illnesses, marijuana can reduce \\nneurological overactivity and muscle spasm. The \\nplant provides effective treatment for glaucoma,  \\nin which pressure within the eye is abnormally  \\nhigh, and is hypotensive, lowering blood pressure. \\nMarijuana relieves asthma, menstrual pains, the pain \\nof childbirth, and of arthritis and rheumatism, and \\nmay have value as an antidepressant. It encourages \\nand induces sleep. The seeds are used in Chinese \\nmedicine as a strong but well-tolerated laxative, \\nespecially for constipation in the elderly; and as a \\ndietary supplement to provide a balanced and \\nhealthy supply of polyunsaturated fatty acids. \\nResearch Modern research shows marijuana to \\nbe a sedative, an anti-inflammatory agent, and an \\nanalgesic as effective as codeine. Research has \\nfocused on the constituent THC, but it is clear that \\nthe complex of constituents within marijuana has a \\nsignificantly wider range of applications. Clinical \\nstudies from 1975 onwards have shown that the \\ncannabinoids are powerfully antiemetic, especially \\nin those having chemotherapy. To varying \\ndegrees, clinical trials indicate that marijuana or its \\ncannabinoids relieves symptoms in multiple \\nsclerosis (such as tremor, muscle spasm, and poor \\ncoordination), in spinal cord injuries, epilepsy, \\nglaucoma, chronic pain, and loss of appetite. Now \\nthat medical marijuana is legally available \\nin a number of U.S. states, there is \\naccumulating evidence of just how \\neffective the herb, and extracts of it, are in \\nrelieving pain. A 2015 article in the Journal of \\nthe American Medical Association found “30% \\nor greater improvement in pain with \\ncannabinoid compared to placebo,” \\ni.e., marijuana extracts on average \\nproduced a 30% or more improvement \\nwhen compared to an inert substance. It also \\nfound that availability of medical-grade marijuana \\nwas associated “with a 15–35% decrease in \\nsubstance abuse admissions.” Not only is medical \\nmarijuana a valuable analgesic, it also helps to \\nprevent addiction to other painkillers, in particular \\nopioids, such as codeine and morphine.\\nCaution Marijuana is a controlled substance in \\nNorth America. Research your local laws. \\nMarijuana leaf\\nCapparis spinosa (Capparaceae)\\nCaper\\nDescription  Shrub growing to 3 ft (1 m), with \\nspiny trailing stems, fleshy oval leaves, green buds, \\nlarge white flowers, and red berries in autumn.\\nHabitat & Cultivation Native to the \\nMediterranean region, caper thrives in open \\nareas, often growing on stony terrain.

They appear to have been a \\ncomponent in remedies for trembling fingers, \\nconstipation, and expelling disease brought on  \\nby demons. Egyptian myth recounts that the \\nwatermelon originated from the semen of  \\nthe god Seth.\\nMedicinal Actions & Uses Watermelon is \\nbest known as a thirst-quenching fruit that comes \\ninto season when temperatures are at their hottest. \\nIn traditional Chinese medicine it is used precisely \\nto counter “summer heat” patterns—characterized \\nby excessive sweating, thirst, raised temperature, \\nscanty urine, diarrhea, and irritability or anger. \\nWatermelon fruit and juice soothe these symptoms, \\nincreasing urine flow and cleansing the kidneys. The \\nfruit’s refreshing properties extend to the digestive \\nsystem, where it clears gas. Watermelon may also \\nbe used in the treatment of hepatitis. In hot, stifling \\nweather it is helpful for those suffering from \\nbronchitis or asthma. The cooling fruit pulp may  \\nbe applied to hot and inflamed skin and to soothe \\nsunburn. The seeds can be mashed and used to \\nexpel worms.\\nRelated Species The watermelons of Egypt  \\n(C. lanata and C. colocynthoides) are very similar \\nspecies.

It is listed in the Ebers papyrus \\n(dating to about 1500 bce), and apparently was \\nmuch employed in ancient Egypt. The herb reached \\nChina during the Han Dynasty (202 bce–220 ce). \\nPliny (23–79 ce) describes its use “for spreading \\nsores … diseased testes, burns, carbuncles, and \\nsore ears, fluxes of the eyes, too, if woman’s milk \\nbe added.”\\nMedicinal Actions & Uses  Coriander is \\nmore often used as a spice than as a medicine. \\nNevertheless, an infusion of the herb is a gentle \\nremedy for flatulence, bloating, and cramps. It \\nsettles spasms within the gut and counters the \\neffects of nervous tension. Coriander is also \\nchewed to sweeten the breath, especially after \\nconsumption of garlic (Allium sativum, p. 59). \\nCoriander seed has been used as an expectorant \\nto treat coughs and bronchitis, and in traditional \\nMiddle Eastern medicine it is taken to calm  \\nanxiety and aid sleep.

It has large, heart-shaped leaves \\nand greenish-white flowers. \\nHabitat & Cultivation Dragon’s blood  \\nis a rainforest tree native to northwestern \\nAmazonia (from Bolivia to Colombia), preferring \\nriverbanks and sites with disturbed soil. It is \\ncultivated by the indigenous peoples there as  \\nan environmentally sustainable crop.\\nParts Used Latex, sap, resin (fresh or dried), bark.\\nConstituents Key constituents within dragon’s \\nblood include proanthocyanidins, mono- and \\nditerpenes, an alkaloid (taspine), and a lignan \\n(dimethylcedrusine). Many constituents, notably \\ntaspine and dimethyldedrusine, have potent  \\nanti-inflammatory and wound healing properties. \\nT aspine also has cancer-fighting and antiviral activity.\\nHistory & Folklore Dragon’s blood derives its \\nname from the deep red sap or latex that oozes \\nfrom the tree when the bark is cut. A prized \\nrainforest medicine, the latex is applied to wounds, \\nfractures, skin infections, and insect bites. Internally, \\nit is taken to treat diarrhea and dysentery, \\nstomach ulcers, viral infections, and as a vaginal \\nbath before and following childbirth. The first \\nwritten record of its use was in 1653 (Bernabe \\nCobo, Historia del Nuevo Mundo). \\nMedicinal Actions & Uses Dragon’s blood is \\na first-rate wound healer and has been described \\nas a “liquid bandage.” Tissue healing and repair is \\nstrongly stimulated, while the chances of infection \\ndeveloping in open wounds and sores is minimized \\ndue to the marked antiseptic action of the latex \\nand its ability to seal off the wound from the open \\nair. The latex (fresh or dried) is a key remedy for \\nherpes, including shingles and genital herpes, and \\nfungal skin infections. T aken internally, it helps to \\ntreat and prevent gastrointestinal infection and \\npeptic ulcers, and to control diarrhea in conditions \\nsuch as ulcerative colitis. A patent U.S. medicine \\n(Crofelemer) derived from dragon’s blood is \\nlicensed for the treatment of chronic diarrhea, \\ntypically in patients with HIV.\\nRelated Species C. lecheri is most commonly \\nused to make dragon’s blood, although similar \\nCroton species grow in Central America. C. flavens \\n(Y ellow balsam), a traditional Mayan and Aztec \\nremedy, is used for fever and infections, and as a \\nwound salve.

Commercially \\ngrown plants are renewed after 4 years. The \\nunopened flower heads and leaves are picked in \\nearly summer.\\nParts Used Flower heads, leaves, root.\\nConstituents All parts of the plant contain the \\nsesquiterpene lactone cynaropicrin (which is strongly \\nbitter) and much inulin. The leaves also contain \\ncynarin, which has liver-protective properties.\\nHistory & Folklore Artichokes were  \\ngreatly valued by the ancient Greeks and Romans. \\nDioscorides (1st century ce) recommended \\napplying the mashed roots to the armpit or \\nelsewhere on the body to sweeten offensive odors.\\nMedicinal Actions & Uses Artichoke is a \\nvaluable medicinal plant. Like milk thistle (Silybum \\nmarianus, p. 137), it benefits the liver, protecting \\nagainst toxins and infection. Though the leaves are \\nparticularly effective, all parts of the plant are \\nbitter and stimulate digestive secretions, especially \\nbile. This makes artichoke useful for the treatment \\nof gallbladder problems, nausea, indigestion, and \\nabdominal distension, with the added benefit that  \\nit lowers blood cholesterol levels. A home recipe \\nfrom the Mediterranean region uses fresh artichoke \\nleaf juice mixed with wine or water as a liver tonic. \\nArtichoke is also taken during the early stages of \\ntype 2 diabetes. It is a good food for diabetics,  \\nas it significantly lowers blood sugar. It is also a \\nuseful diuretic, and in France it has been used to \\ntreat rheumatic conditions.\\nResearch Research with laboratory animals  \\nin the late 1990s has shown that artichoke has  \\na powerful positive effect on the liver. Artichoke \\nextracts, and cynaroside in particular, appear to \\nreduce cholesterol synthesis in the liver, while leaf \\nextracts are strongly antioxidant and liver protective.\\nCyperus esculentus (Cyperaceae)\\nChufa, \\nTiger Nut\\nDescription Erect, grass-like plant growing to \\n20 in (50 cm). Has cylindrical brown tubers, lance-\\nshaped leaves, and rays of small spikes of green-\\nbrown flowers.\\nHabitat & Cultivation Native to the \\nMediterranean region, chufa was first introduced to \\nSpain and North Africa by the Arabs. It now grows \\nworldwide, including in India. The tubers (called \\n“nuts”) are unearthed in winter and summer.\\nParts Used Tubers.\\nConstituents Chufa contains 20–36% fixed oil, \\nknown as chufa or tiger nut oil.\\nHistory & Folklore Chufa nuts have been \\nfound in the excavations of the earliest settlements \\nin the Nile Valley, and since ancient times they have \\nremained a popular food in the region. The Greek \\nphysician Dioscorides, writing in the 1st century ce, \\nmentions their ability to comfort the stomach.\\nMedicinal Actions & Uses Chufa is regarded \\nas a digestive tonic, having a heating and drying effect \\non the digestive system and alleviating flatulence. It \\nalso promotes urine production and menstruation. \\nThe juice is taken to heal ulcers of the mouth and \\ngums. Ayurvedic medicine classifies the nuts as \\ndigestive, tonic, and aphrodisiac. \\nRelated Species  Many other species of \\nCyperus are used as foods or medicines. For \\nexample, in Chinese herbal medicine C. rotundus \\nis used as a liver tonic, to counter indigestion and \\nto promote menstruation. C. stolonifera , native to \\ntropical regions of Asia and Australia, is thought \\nto ease stomach pain and act as a heart stimulant. \\nPerhaps the most famous Cyperus species of all  \\nis papyrus (C. papyrus ). This plant provided fiber \\nfor the first writing paper, invented by the ancient \\nEgyptians. Papyrus was also chewed like sugar cane, \\nand used medicinally in eye compresses and to \\nbandage wounds.\\nLemon grass makes  \\na soothing tea.\\nArtichoke flower heads are nourishing and beneficial for the \\nliver and digestion. \\nCypripedium pubescens \\n(Orchidaceae)\\nLady’s Slipper, \\nAmerican Valerian\\nDescription  Perennial orchid with several  \\nstems sheathed by broad lance-shaped leaves.  \\nHas beautiful, complex golden-yellow and purple \\nflowers in late summer.\\nHabitat & Cultivation This herb is native to \\neastern North America.

It was commonly taken \\nto ease menstrual and labor pains, and to counter \\ninsomnia and nervous conditions. The Cherokee \\nused one variety to treat worms in children. In the \\nAnglo-American Physiomedicalist tradition, lady’s \\nslipper had many uses. Swinburne Clymer (in Nature’s \\nHealing Agents, 1905) considered the plant “of special \\nvalue in reflex functional disorders, or chorea, \\nhysteria, nervous headache, insomnia, low fevers, \\nnervous unrest, hypochondria, and nervous \\ndepression accompanying stomach disorders.”\\nMedicinal Actions & Uses Due to its scarcity \\nand cost, lady’s slipper is now rarely used. A sedative \\nand relaxing herb, it treats anxiety, stress-related \\ndisorders such as palpitations, headaches, muscular \\ntension, panic attacks, and neurotic conditions \\ngenerally. Like valerian (Valeriana officinalis, p. 148), \\nlady’s slipper is an effective tranquilizer. It reduces \\nemotional tension and often calms the mind \\nsufficiently to allow sleep. Indeed, its restorative \\neffect appears to be more positive than that  \\nof valerian.\\nCaution In view of its rarity, lady’s slipper should \\nno longer be used medicinally. \\nMyddfai recommend broom as a means to treat \\nsuppressed urine: “seek broom seed, and grind \\ninto fine powder, mix with drink and let it be \\ndrank. Do this till you are quite well.” Broom tops \\nhave been pickled and used as a condiment similar \\nto capers (Capparis spinosa, p. 182).\\nMedicinal Actions & Uses Broom is used \\nmainly as a remedy for an irregular, fast heartbeat. \\nThe plant acts on the electrical conductivity of the \\nheart, slowing and regulating the transmission  \\nof the impulses. Broom is also strongly diuretic, \\nstimulating urine production and thus countering \\nfluid retention. Since broom causes the muscles of \\nthe uterus to contract, it has been used to prevent \\nblood loss after childbirth.\\n QCautions T ake broom internally only under \\nprofessional supervision. Do not take during \\npregnancy, or if suffering from high blood pressure. \\nThe plant is subject to legal restrictions in  \\nsome countries.\\nHistory & Folklore Mezereon was formerly \\nwell used in northern Europe, both internally as  \\na purgative and externally as an ointment for \\ncancerous sores and skin ulcers. The Swedish \\nnaturalist Carolus Linnaeus (1707–1778) recorded \\nthat the bark was applied to the bites of poisonous \\nreptiles and rabid dogs. People have reportedly \\ndied simply from eating birds that have eaten the \\nhighly poisonous berries.\\nMedicinal Actions & Uses Today, mezereon \\nis considered too poisonous to be ingested. \\nMezereon is used occasionally as an external \\ncounterirritant and is effective on rheumatic  \\njoints, increasing blood flow to the affected area. \\n RCautions Under no circumstances should \\nmezereon be taken internally.

The tropane \\nalkaloids are similar to those found in deadly \\nnightshade (Atropa belladonna, p. 69), acting to \\nreduce secretions and relax smooth muscle.\\nHistory & Folklore Thornapple has a long \\nhistory of medicinal use. If taken in sufficient doses, \\nit causes hallucinations; the Delphic oracle in ancient \\nGreece and the Inca in South America may have \\nused it as an aid to making prophecies. Though it is \\nhallucinogenic, thornapple has traditionally been \\nused to treat insanity.\\nMedicinal Actions & Uses At low doses, \\nthornapple is a common remedy for asthma, \\nwhooping cough, muscle spasms, and the \\nsymptoms of Parkinsonism. It relaxes the muscles \\nof the gastrointestinal, bronchial, and urinary tracts, \\nand reduces digestive and mucous secretions.

Cultivated carrot \\nroot contains sugars, pectin, carotene, vitamins, \\nminerals, and asparagine. Carrot leaves contain \\nsignificant amounts of porphyrins, which stimulate \\nthe pituitary gland and lead to the release of \\nincreased levels of sex hormones.\\nHistory & Folklore The origins of the familiar \\ngarden carrot are a mystery—it was cultivated as a \\nnutritious and cleansing food at least as long ago as \\nancient Greece and Rome. In the 1st century ce, the \\nphysician Dioscorides recommended the seeds to \\nstimulate menstruation, to relieve urinary \\nretention, and to “wake up the genital virtue.”  \\nThe cultivated variety did not reach Britain until the \\n16th century, when women used its beautiful, \\nfinely divided leaves to adorn their hair.\\nMedicinal Actions & Uses This common \\nvegetable is also a wonderfully cleansing medicine. \\nIt supports the liver, and stimulates urine flow and \\nthe removal of waste by the kidneys. The juice of \\norganically grown carrots is a delicious drink and  \\na valuable detoxifier. Carrots are rich in carotene, \\nwhich is converted to vitamin A by the liver. The \\nraw root, grated or mashed, is a safe treatment for \\nthreadworms, especially in children. Wild carrot \\nleaves are a good diuretic. They have been used to \\ncounter cystitis and kidney stone formation, and  \\nto diminish stones that have already formed. The \\nseeds are also diuretic. They stimulate menstruation \\nand have been used in folk medicine as a treatment \\nfor hangovers. Both leaves and seeds relieve \\nflatulence and settle the digestion.\\nResearch In a study published in 1995, a carrot \\nextract was shown to protect the liver from toxicity.\\nCautions Do not take carrot seeds during \\npregancy. Use only organic carrot juice since  \\nthe root concentrates artificial fertilizers  \\nand insecticides. \\nMedicinal Actions & Uses Desmodium is \\nchiefly a remedy for asthma and has been used as \\nan antiasthmatic in Ghanaian hospitals. In France, \\nthe herb is taken for liver disorders including viral \\nhepatitis—both A and B—apparently having most \\neffect during the early stages.

In his 1656 The Art of \\nSimpling, herbalist William Coles described the \\nplant: “its stalks all to be speckled like a snake or \\nviper, and is a most singular remedy against poison \\nand the sting of scorpions.” Four years earlier, the \\nEnglish herbalist Nicholas Culpeper had praised its \\naction against “the biting of vipers.”\\nMedicinal Actions & Uses In many respects, \\nviper’s bugloss is similar to borage (Borago officinalis, \\np. 179), in that both herbs have a sweat-inducing \\nand diuretic effect if taken internally. Viper’s bugloss \\nhas also been taken to treat chest conditions, as its \\nmucilage soothes dry coughs and encourages \\nexpectoration.

It is now one of the world’s most \\nimportant food crops.\\nMedicinal Actions & Uses Although \\nsoybeans and soy produce have little direct \\nmedicinal value, they are highly important as foods, \\nproviding unusually high levels of protein, lecithin, \\nand essential fatty acids. However, the beans may \\nhave a protective role against cancer, notably \\nbreast cancer. Their significant estrogenic activity \\nmakes them a particularly good medicinal food for \\nwomen going through menopause, helping  \\nto relieve symptoms such as hot flashes, and to \\nprotect against osteoporosis. In Chinese medicine, \\nsoybean sprouts (also highly nutritious) are \\nthought to help relieve “summer heat” and fever.\\nResearch Soybean is a remarkable nutrient, rich \\nin protein, fats, and estrogenic substances, all of \\nwhich make it an excellent food. The isoflavones, \\nsterols, saponins, and fiber contribute to soy’s \\nprotective activity against cancer, and countries such \\nas Japan are thought to have lower levels of cancer \\nbecause of the great quantity of soy produce eaten \\nthere. The isoflavones, coumestrol, and sterols are \\nall phytoestrogens. These appear to inhibit estrogen \\nwithin the body when estrogen levels are too high \\n(for example, in menstrual disorders), and to \\ncompensate when estrogen levels are low (such as \\nduring menopause).

It also acts on the heart \\nto correct an irregular heartbeat.\\nHistory & Folklore  White \\nhorehound has been a remedy for \\nchest problems since ancient times, perhaps  \\nmost frequently taken as a syrup made with  \\nhoney or sugar. The Greek physician Dioscorides \\n(40–90 ce) recommended a decoction of white \\nhorehound as a treatment for tuberculosis, \\nasthma, and coughs.\\nMedicinal Actions & Uses White horehound \\nis helpful for wheeziness, bronchitis, bronchiectasis \\n(a damaged air passage within the lung), bronchial \\nasthma, non-productive coughs, and whooping \\ncough. The herb apparently causes the secretion \\nof a more fluid mucus, which is readily cleared  \\nby coughing. As a bitter tonic, white horehound \\nincreases the appetite and supports the function \\nof the stomach. It is widely used in Mexico to  \\nhelp control type 2 diabetes.

The \\nroot is unearthed before flowering or after  \\nthe fruit has ripened.\\nPart Used Root.\\nConstituents Notoginseng contains steroidal \\nsaponins, polysaccharides, and a flavonoid.\\nHistory & Folklore Despite its importance as \\na tonic, notoginseng was only recorded in Chinese \\nherbal medicine in 1578, in the Compendium of \\nMateria Medica by Li Shizen. He described the  \\nroot as being “more valuable than gold.”\\nMedicinal Actions & Uses Like ginseng  \\n(P. ginseng, p. 118), notoginseng is a tonic that \\nsupports the function of the adrenal glands,  \\nin particular the production of corticosteroids  \\nand male sex hormones. Notoginseng also helps to \\nimprove blood flow through the coronary arteries, \\nthus finding use as a treatment for arteriosclerosis, \\nhigh blood pressure, and angina. Notoginseng \\ntreats internal bleeding of almost any kind. The \\nherb may also be applied externally as a poultice  \\nto help speed the healing of wounds and bruises.\\nResearch Clinical studies have confirmed \\nnotoginseng’s longstanding reputation as a means \\nto arrest bleeding. A Chinese trial indicated that  \\nthe herb hastens blood clotting. Another clinical \\ntrial and extensive scientific studies, again in \\nChina, associated the herb with positive \\nimprovements in coronary circulation, in lessening \\nthe symptoms of angina, and in the reduction of \\nblood pressure levels. In common with other \\nginseng-type herbs, notoginseng has been shown \\nto enhance physical performance.\\nCaution Do not take during pregnancy.\\nPanax quinquefolium (Araliaceae)\\nAmerican Ginseng\\nDescription Deciduous perennial growing to \\nabout 1 ft (30 cm).

The \\nOjibwa people always planted a seed to replace  \\nthe herb, but this was not universal practice. \\nAmerican ginseng became rare toward the end  \\nof the 19th century.\\nMedicinal Actions & Uses  The action of \\nAmerican ginseng is presumed to be similar to,  \\nbut milder than, that of its Chinese cousin, ginseng  \\n(P. ginseng, p. 118).

During the summer, the seed \\ncapsules are cut and the white latex that exudes is \\ngathered the next day and dried.\\nPart Used Latex.\\nConstituents Opium poppy contains more  \\nthan 40 opium alkaloids, including morphine  \\n(up to 20%), narcotine (about 5%), codeine  \\n(about 1%), and papaverine (about 1%). It also \\ncontains meconic acid, albumin, mucilage, sugars, \\nresin, and wax. Many of the opium poppy’s  \\nalkaloids have a well-established therapeutic  \\naction. Morphine is one of the most powerful \\nanalgesics of all, used extensively in conventional \\nmedicine to relieve pain, especially in terminal \\nillness. Codeine is a milder analgesic used for \\nheadaches and other pain, and in the symptomatic \\ntreatment of diarrhea. Opium’s strongly addictive \\nnature is well established.\\nHistory & Folklore Cultivated for its \\nmedicinal properties for at least 4,000 years,  \\nthe opium poppy was introduced to Greece \\nabout 3,000 years ago, and from there spread \\nthroughout Europe. It was unknown in China  \\nuntil the 7th century ce, and in Japan until the \\n15th century. It is mentioned in the Assyrian \\nherbals (c. 1700 bce), and the Greek physician \\nDioscorides (40–90 ce) wrote that “a decoction of \\nthe leaves and flowerheads if drunk and bathed on \\nthe head is unrivaled in inducing sleep. The mashed \\nheads, mixed with flour, make a useful plaster in \\ninflammations and St. Anthony’s fire [erysipelas, a \\nbacterial infection of the skin].”\\nMedicinal Actions & Uses Opium (the  \\ndried latex) is a potent narcotic, analgesic, and \\nantispasmodic, and has been taken to relieve pain \\nof various kinds. In all the main herbal traditions it is \\nregarded as a powerfully “cold” remedy, reducing \\nphysical function and sedating or suppressing \\nnervous activity, pain, and coughs. In view of its \\naddictive nature, opium is mainly used after other \\nless powerful analgesics have failed to bring relief. It \\nis also an effective remedy for acute diarrhea and \\nsevere coughs.

The seeds are highly \\npoisonous—2 are sufficient to kill an adult—but the \\ntoxins do not pass into the expressed oil.\\nHistory & Folklore Castor oil has been used \\nmedicinally for about 4,000 years. Until recently, it \\nwas a common remedy given regularly to children \\n“to help keep the system clear.” Owing to its \\nunpleasant taste, castor oil is remembered \\nas the bane of many childhoods.\\nMedicinal Actions & Uses Castor oil \\nis well known for its strongly laxative  \\n(and, in higher doses, purgative) action, \\nprompting a bowel movement about \\n3–5 hours after ingestion. The  \\noil is so effective that it is \\nregularly used to clear the \\ndigestive tract in cases of \\npoisoning.

Native healers are able to distinguish \\nbetween what are botanically identical plants, \\nselecting those that have a low TOA content  \\nand are therefore most likely to prove effective  \\nin strengthening immunity. \\nMedicinal Actions & Uses  Like echinacea \\n(Echinacea spp., p. 92), with which it combines \\neffectively, cat’s claw supports a weakened \\nimmune system, and can reinvigorate the body’s \\nefforts to counter infection and inflammation. \\nThe herb’s antioxidant activity also helps to \\ncontain the widespread cellular damage that \\noccurs in chronic degenerative disease. \\nConditions that may benefit include infections \\nsuch as chronic fatigue syndrome and HIV/AIDS; \\nchronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid \\narthritis and ulcerative colitis; and asthma.  \\nCat’s claw may also be taken to help prevent \\ncancer, particularly breast cancer, and is  \\nuseful in countering the damaging effects  \\nof chemotherapy.\\nResearch Investigations into the root and stem \\nbark have established that cat’s claw has potent  \\nanti-inflammatory, antioxidant and immune-stimulant \\nactivity. The POAs and water extracts of the bark \\nstimulate production of white blood cells and \\nnonspecific immune resistance, and appear to inhibit \\ntumor development and growth; extracts of the \\nbark are strongly anti-inflammatory and may inhibit \\ninflammatory gene expression. Nevertheless, the \\nbark’s medicinal activity probably results from the \\nsynergistic effect of several compounds, including \\nthe tannins. Clinical research in Peru indicates that \\ncat’s claw may have use in the treatment for HIV and \\nAIDS. Of the two types of cat’s claw, only the one \\ncontaining POAs should be used as medicine, since \\nthe TOAs may suppress immune function. Cat’s claw \\nhas a contraceptive activity.

T aken as berries, juice, or \\nextract, it will help to disinfect the urinary tubules \\nand may be taken for problems associated with \\npoor urinary flow such as enlarged prostate, as  \\nwell as bladder infections. In cases of acute infection, \\ncranberry is likely to work better in combination \\nwith herbs such as buchu (Barosma betulina, p. 71) \\nand uva-ursi (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, p. 170). \\nCranberry may also be used long term to prevent the \\ndevelopment of calcium carbonate urinary stones.\\nResearch Research published in 1994 found that \\ncranberry juice reduced the need for antibiotics  \\nin women suffering from chronic urinary tract \\ninfection. It seems likely that cranberry works by \\nmaking it more difficult for bacteria to cling to the \\nurinary tract wall, and infection is therefore more \\neasily flushed out.

Less hardy plants \\nshould be moved to sheltered sites or indoors \\nduring winter.\\nGrowing Plants Under Cover\\nSheltered gardening offers the opportunity to \\ngrow more unusual plants. Use the greenhouse  \\nto cultivate exotic plants, such as lemon grass \\n(Cymbopogon citratus, p. 198), for medicinal and \\nculinary use, as well as for growing seedlings to  \\nbe planted outdoors. Tender plants, such as holy \\nbasil (Ocimum tenuiflorum, p. 116), thrive indoors, \\nand some indoor plants, such as aloe vera (Aloe \\nvera, p. 60), have the added advantage of absorbing \\npolluting chemicals from the air.\\nBuying Medicinal Herbs\\nReputable herb nurseries are the best place  \\nto buy herbs when particular varieties or  \\nspecies are required. Be clear about what  \\nplants you want before visiting the nursery.  \\nWhen buying for medicinal use, purchase the \\nstandard medicinal, rather than an improved  \\nor ornamental variety.\\nThe Medicinal Herb Garden\\nPlanning an herb garden depends on a range of \\nfactors including the space available, exposure, soil, \\nconditions, and climate. As a starting point, details \\nof ten of the most common and useful medicinal \\nplants for growing in temperate climates are given \\nin the chart below. Some of them, such as thyme \\n(Thymus vulgaris, p. 143) and sage (Salvia officinalis,  \\np. 131), may be grown indoors. A number of other \\nmedicinal herbs, including German chamomile \\n(Chamomilla recutita, p. 77), lady’s mantle (Alchemilla \\nvulgaris, p. 163), and lavender (Lavandula officinalis, \\np. 108) also grow well in a temperate climate and \\nare well worth cultivating. If in doubt about how  \\nto care for plants or what will grow well in your \\ngarden, consult a nursery.\\nOutdoor Gardens\\nChoose a range of hardy herbs to grow in your \\ngarden that will establish themselves easily and \\nproduce plenty of foliage that can be harvested. \\nPlant exotic or less hardy herbs in sheltered sunny \\nsites or in containers.\\nContainer Gardens\\nMany medicinal plants such as peppermint  \\n(Mentha x piperita, p. 114) or bay laurel  \\n(Laurus nobilis, p. 226) can be grown in pots,  \\nCultivation\\nBear in mind the following points when planning \\nthe garden and choosing herbs.\\nSite\\nThe majority of medicinal plants prefer a sunny \\nexposure and moderately well-drained soil. It is \\npossible to improve a site, for example by planting \\nhedges as windbreaks. Choose sheltered, sunny \\ncorners for delicate and half-hardy herbs, and  \\navoid planting on land formerly used for industrial \\npurposes, which may be contaminated.\\nT emperature\\nSome plants tolerate only very specific \\ntemperature ranges, and many herbs, such as \\nrosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis, p. 128), are only \\nhalf-hardy and will not survive exposure to deep \\nor long periods of frost. Protect tender and half-\\nhardy plants from the wind to avoid the windchill \\nfactor. Spring is the best time to plant most herbs. \\nWintering plants in a greenhouse or cool indoor \\nsite is often the only way to keep subtropical plants \\nin cool temperate climates, while other herbs will \\nthrive indoors all year round in a warm, sunny \\nposition.\\nSoil\\nSoils vary greatly depending on the proportions  \\nof sand, silt, and clay content. Sandy soils drain \\neasily and need feeding, while clay soils can become \\nwaterlogged and require drainage.\\nPruning\\nPruning is used to remove dead wood and  \\nimprove the shape, size, and quality of growth.  \\nIt is an important garden activity and needs to  \\nbe done correctly for different woody plants  \\nto benefit—check the best time of year for each \\nplant.

Choose  \\nthe one most suited to the plant. \\nWhen planting, prepare the ground \\nin advance, taking into account the \\nrequirements of the individual plant, \\nand the soil, site, and time of year, as well \\nas the anticipated size of the mature plant.\\nSeed\\nSeeds can be sown either in containers or in \\nprepared soil in open ground. It is important to \\ntime the sowing of seeds to enable seedlings to \\nbe planted outdoors when weather and soil become \\nsufficiently warm. Annuals and biennials can be grown \\nwith ease from seed and will grow vigorously \\nthroughout the summer. Check the germination \\nrequirements of perennials before buying seeds, as \\nsome varieties germinate easily, while others, such as \\nSiberian ginseng (Eleutherococcus senticosus, p. 94), can \\nbe far more difficult.\\nCuttings\\nThis is one of the most popular methods of \\npropagation. It is suitable for woody perennial \\nherbs. Cuttings are usually taken from the stem, \\nalthough some plants may also be propagated  \\nfrom roots. Choose young, healthy plants and take \\nthe cutting just below a leaf and stem joint using  \\na clean, sharp knife. Strip off the lowest leaves and \\ndip the stem in hormone rooting preparation before \\ninserting it in suitable soil mix. Some plants are \\nvery difficult to propagate this way, so check before \\nattempting this method.\\nRoot Division\\nThis is an easy way to propagate plants that form \\nclumps. Divide spring-flowering herbaceous plants \\nin autumn, and autumn-flowering herbaceous \\nplants in spring. Carefully lift a mature plant, divide \\nit into smaller sections, and replant both the new \\nand the mature plant.\\nPlants from Produce\\nPurchase pots of culinary herbs from a grocery  \\nor supermarket, split the seedlings into 3 to 4 \\nsmall clumps, and pot them \\nseparately. Fresh roots, such as \\nginger (Zingiber officinale , p. 155), \\nor bulblets, such as garlic ( Allium \\nsativum, p. 59), can be planted in pots \\nor in prepared ground outside, if \\ntemperature allows.\\nLayering\\nLayering involves encouraging a \\nshoot or stem to form roots by \\nmaking a small slit in its underside \\nand burying it, with the growing tip \\nabove ground. When the layer \\nroots emerge, remove and pot. \\n“Mound layering” is suitable for \\nwoody herbs such as  \\nsage (Salvia officinalis, p. 131).  \\nPile free-draining soil over \\nthe base of the plant, and \\nwhen the layered stems \\nform new roots, remove \\nand pot.\\nherbal remedies for home use\\nencourages fresh growth. Pruning and tidying the \\ngarden regularly also reduces pests and diseases.\\nWatering\\nWater well after planting and then, if needed,  \\nonce a week (rather than a little each day) in the \\nmorning or early evening. Do not overwater as \\nmany herbs produce medicinally active constituents \\nin dry conditions. Water dry potted plants \\nthoroughly before planting.\\nWeeding & Fertilizing\\nWeeding is necessary since weeds compete with  \\nother plants for nutrients and water. Keep beds  \\nand containers as free from weeds as possible.  \\nMost medicinal herbs should not be fed or \\nmulched as this tends to reduce their therapeutic \\nstrength. However, sandy soils should be fed with  \\na good-quality fertilizer to maintain the nutrients  \\nin the soil.\\nPests & Diseases\\nUse only organic methods to treat pests, diseases, \\nand insect infestation. Aphids can be eradicated \\nusing soapy water or water in which garlic skins \\nhave been soaked for 2 days. Separate any infected \\nplants to prevent further contamination.\\nCultivated herb gardens can create a colorful, aromatic area with the added benefit of providing a ready supply of fresh herbs \\nto use both medicinally and in cooking.\\nSowing Seeds in Containers\\n2 \\nOnce the seeds have germinated, fill a number  \\nof pots with soil mix. Gently lift up a seedling, \\ninsert it in a small hole in the soil mix, and pack the \\nsoil around it. Water thoroughly and do not allow to \\ndry out.\\n1\\nFill a seed tray with seed soil mix and water well. \\nSprinkle on the seeds, covering large seeds with  \\na fine layer of compost. Cover the tray with glass or \\nplace in a plastic bag and store in a warm place (up \\nto 70°F/21°C).\\nOffsets\\nOffsets are produced from most herbs that grow  \\nfrom a bulb or corm, such as garlic (Allium sativum,  \\np. 59). These can be detached during dormancy \\nand replanted.\\nFresh ginger root rapidly produces many new shoots if \\nplanted in moist compost in warm conditions above 70°F \\n(21°C).\\nUS_286-287_Growing_Medicinal_Plant.indd   287 26/02/16   4:43 pm\\n'),\n",

Do not harvest bark from the wild.\\nBefore harvesting, consider where the plant is \\ngrowing and whether it could be contaminated \\nby pollution. Do not collect from roadsides, \\nclose to factories, or in areas where crop \\nspraying has occurred.\\nHarvesting from Your Garden\\nCultivated herbs provide a ready supply of  \\nfresh material in a controlled environment.  \\nCut perennials carefully so that plants can  \\nquickly regrow. Some plants, such as lemon  \\nbalm (Melissa officinalis, p. 113), provide two  \\nor more crops per year.\\nGeneral Advice\\nHarvesting medicinal herbs requires careful \\nplanning to ensure the parts are processed in  \\npeak condition and fast enough to retain their \\nactive ingredients.\\nEquipment\\nIdeally, use a wooden tray or open basket for \\ncollecting herbs. This prevents the plant being \\ncrushed. In the wild, a non-nylon rucksack or  \\nHarvesting from the Wild\\nWild plants offer a free and natural source of \\nherbal remedies. Furthermore, active constituents \\nare often more highly concentrated in wild  \\nplants since the herb is likely to be growing in its \\npreferred habitat.\\nIdentification\\nProper identification of wild plants is essential.  \\nUse a field or wildflower guide to help you. If \\nin doubt, do not pick the plant, as poisoning can \\nresult from misidentification.\\nEcological & Legal Factors\\nWhile common species, such as nettle (Urtica \\ndioica, p. 146), may be readily harvested from \\nthe wild, many rarer species are under great \\npressure due to the lack of a suitable habitat.  \\nIn many countries it is illegal to uproot any wild \\nplant, and certain species may be protected. \\nAlthough gathering medicinal plants such as \\ngentian (Gentiana lutea, p. 99) may be legal in \\nsome countries, it will only reduce their future \\nchances of survival in the wild. Never pick rare  \\nor uncommon plants from the wild, even if they  \\nare locally plentiful, and do not collect more than \\nsack may be more appropriate. Always cut with  \\na sharp knife or scissors to minimize damage to  \\nthe plant and try to handle plants as little as \\npossible. Wear gloves if gathering prickly or \\nallergenic plants, such as rue (Ruta graveolens,  \\np. 265).\\nWhat to Look For\\nCollect material from healthy plants, free from \\ninsect damage and pollution. It is important  \\nto discard damaged plants because they can lead  \\nto disease or decay in dried plant material. Do  \\nnot mix cut plant material to avoid mistakes  \\nin identification. \\nWhen to Harvest\\nGather herbs in dry weather, preferably on a  \\nsunny morning after the dew has evaporated. \\nPicking when the plant is at its peak of maturity \\nensures that it will have a high concentration of \\nactive constituents. Unless otherwise stated in  \\nthe individual plant entries on pp. 56–283, leaves  \\nare best collected as they open during the spring  \\nor summer months, flowers as they start to  \\nbloom, fruit and berries just as they become  \\nripe, and roots in the autumn once the plant  \\nhas drawn its vitality back beneath ground. Bark \\nmust be gathered with great care if the shrub  \\nor tree is to survive—in most cases, harvest it  \\nin spring or autumn.\\nThe Correct Medicinal Part\\nIn many cases, different parts of the same plant,  \\nfor example the leaves and seeds, can have quite \\ndifferent actions and uses. Make sure that you \\nharvest the correct medicinal part of the plant  \\nfor your purposes.\\nProcessing Quickly\\nOnly collect plant material that you will be able to \\nuse or process immediately after harvesting. This  \\nis because fresh plant material deteriorates very \\nquickly and the medicinally active constituents are \\noften the first to be affected. In particular, aromatic \\nherbs can lose their volatile oils within hours. Salad \\nleaves and culinary herbs are best eaten right \\naway to make the most of their nutrients, although \\nthey can be stored for a few days in a plastic bag \\nfilled with air in a refrigerator.\\nStoring Herbs\\nIt is vital to store dried herbs properly or they  \\nwill not last. Leaves, flowers, roots, and other \\nparts should be stored in sterilized, dark glass \\ncontainers with airtight lids. They may also be \\nstored in new brown paper bags, which must be \\nkept dry and away from light. Metal and plastic \\ncontainers are inadvisable because they may \\ncontaminate the herb. If stored in a cool, dark \\nplace, herbs can be kept for about 12 months \\nafter harvesting. Herbs frozen in plastic bags can \\nbe used for up to 6 months. Label the container \\nwith the herb, source, date of harvesting, and \\nstrength of preparation if appropriate. Watch out \\nHarvesting & Processing\\nAlthough there are some herbs that may be collected year round, most have  \\na particular growing season and must be harvested and either used immediately \\nor preserved for use in the following year. See the individual entries on  \\npp. 56–283 for harvesting times. Herbs need to be processed quickly to \\nprevent deterioration and retain their healing action.\\nRamsons can be found carpeting shady sites in damp woods in Europe. The bulb and aerial parts are harvested in early \\nsummer for their antibiotic, healing properties.\\nUS_288-289_Harvesting_And_Processing.indd   288 17/03/16   4:01 pm'),\n",

If this occurs, discard all \\naffected material and sterilize the container.\\nProcessing\\nHerbs can be preserved in a number of ways, the \\nsimplest being air or oven drying. A warm, dry \\nplace such as an airing cupboard is ideal. Use plain \\npaper for drying herbs, never printed newspaper. \\nDried herbs can be stored for many months in a \\ndark glass jar or a brown paper bag (see p. 288).\\nAerial Parts\\nThese include all the parts of the plant growing \\nabove ground—stems, leaves, flowers, berries, and \\nseeds. The stems are normally cut 2–4 in (5 –10 \\ncm) above ground shortly after the plant has \\nbegun to flower, when it is putting most effort into \\ngrowth. Perennials may be cut higher above \\nground to encourage further crops. Remove and \\ndry large flowers and leaves separately; smaller \\nones can be dried on the stem. \\n■ Hang bunches of about 8–10 stems in a warm \\n(but not hot), well-ventilated, dark place. Ensure \\nthat the stems and leaves are not too tightly  \\npacked together to enable air to circulate freely \\naround them.\\n■ Once brittle but not bone dry, separate small \\nstems, leaves, flowers, and seeds from the stems by \\nrubbing the bunches over a large sheet of plain paper.\\n■ Carefully pour the dried material into a dark glass \\njar or a brown paper bag.\\nLarge Flowers\\nIn most cases, flowers are picked just after they \\nhave opened. Sometimes only specific parts of  \\nthe flower are used, such as the petals of calendula \\n(Calendula officinalis, p. 73), while other flowers are \\nused whole.\\n■ Separate large flower heads from stems and \\nremove any insects or dirt. Place the flowers on \\nabsorbent paper on a tray in a dry place, allowing \\nsufficient room between them for air to circulate.\\n■ Once dry, store flower heads in a brown paper \\nbag or dark glass jar. Remove calendula petals from \\nthe central part of the flower before storing.\\nSmall Flowers\\nSmall blooms can be picked with the stalk attached \\nand separated later. Hang small flowers, such as \\nlavender (Lavandula officinalis, p. 108), upside down \\nin a paper bag, or suspended over a tray (see \\ndrying seeds below). If the stems are fleshy, dry  \\nas for large flowers, above.\\nFruit & Berries\\nHarvest fruit and berries in early autumn when \\nripe but still firm. If left to become over-ripe,  \\nthey may not dry properly. They can be picked \\nindividually or in bunches.\\n■ Place berries or fruit on absorbent paper on \\ntrays. Put in a warmed oven (turned off) with the \\ndoor ajar for 3–4 hours. Move to a dry, warm, dark \\nsite and turn occasionally. Discard any moldy \\nberries or fruit.\\nBrightly colored petals indicate high levels of  \\nactive constituents.\\nA drying rack for herbs can be simply made by covering a \\nwooden frame with wire mesh.\\nRoots, Rhizomes, T ubers, & Bulbs\\nThe underground parts of the plant are usually \\ngathered in autumn after the aerial parts have \\nwithered or become inactive and before the soil  \\nis waterlogged or frozen. Many roots may also  \\nbe collected in early spring before the aerial parts \\nbegin to grow. Dig deeply around the root, prying \\nit out of the ground. Some tap roots are difficult to \\nuproot completely. Remove the required amount \\nand replant the remaining root.\\n■ Shake off any soil and wash thoroughly in warm \\nwater, removing any small, unwanted side roots  \\nor damaged soft spots. Chop into small slices or \\npieces with a sharp knife.\\n■ Spread out the root pieces on absorbent paper \\non a tray and place in a warmed oven (turned off) \\nwith the door ajar for 2–3 hours. Move to a warm \\nplace until dry.\\nSeeds\\nCollect ripe seed pods, capsules, or flowering  \\nstems in late summer before the seeds have  \\nbeen scattered.\\n■ For tiny seeds, hang small bunches of seedheads \\nupside down over a paper-lined tray, or place in a \\npaper bag. Allow to dry and gently shake. Remove \\nlarger seeds by hand when dry.\\nSap & Gel\\nOnly harvest sap from your own garden. Collect \\nsap in the spring as it rises, or as it falls in the \\nautumn. Trees such as silver birch (Betula pendula, \\np. 178) produce huge quantities of sap if tapped, \\nalthough this reduces the tree’s vitality. Bore a deep \\nhole into the trunk—no more than a quarter of \\nits diameter—and place a collecting cup under \\nthe hole. In spring, quarts of sap may be \\nproduced, and it is essential to stop the hole \\nwith resin or wood filler after about a quart (liter) \\nof fluid has been removed. Collect milky juices or \\nlatex from plants such as dandelion ( Taraxacum \\nofficinale , p. 141) by squeezing the stems over a \\nbowl. Wear gloves, because latex or sap can be \\ncorrosive. The gel from aloe vera (Aloe vera, p. 60) \\nis scraped out after slicing the leaf lengthwise and \\npeeling back the edges.\\nBark\\nOnly harvest bark from your own shrubs  \\nor trees as it carries the risk of losing the whole \\nplant through overstripping or “ringing” (removing \\na whole band of bark). It is best to collect bark \\nfrom outlying branches, which can then be pruned \\nback. If stripping bark from a plant, gather it in \\nautumn when the sap is falling. Remove insects, \\nlichen, and moss from the bark, cut it into small \\npieces, and place it on a tray to dry.\\nOther Ways to Preserve Herbs\\nApart from simply air-drying herbs, there are a \\nnumber of other ways to preserve their medicinal \\nbenefits.\\nDehumidifying\\nAn effective but expensive way to dry herbs is to \\nuse a dehumidifier, which literally sucks water out \\nof the plant. The dehumidifier should be placed  \\nin a more or less sealed small room in which the \\nherbs are hung in loose bunches or placed on \\nmesh trays. \\nFreeze-drying\\nFreeze-drying retains color and flavor but is more \\nsuited to culinary than to medicinal herbs. Whole \\nsprigs of herbs can be frozen in plastic bags. There \\nis no need to defrost before use as the leaves \\ncrumble easily when still frozen. Chickweed (Stellaria \\nmedia, p. 272) can also be frozen and used topically \\nfor itchy and weeping skin conditions. Many plants \\nmay be juiced (see p. 297), frozen as ice cubes, and \\nthawed as required.\\nMicrowaving\\nIt is possible to dry herbs in a microwave oven, \\nthough this is not recommended. The cut parts \\nshould be spread out on kitchen paper and dried  \\nin the microwave according to the manufacturer’s \\nguidelines.\\nUS_288-289_Harvesting_And_Processing.indd   289 26/02/16   4:43 pm\\n'),\n",

Metric measurements of grams and liters \\nare generally much easier to use than imperial \\nmeasures when making remedies. If it is difficult \\nto weigh a small quantity, such as 10 g, on your \\nscales, measure double the weight; i.e., 20 g, then \\nhalve the quantity. Liquids can be measured  \\nin a kitchen measuring jug, although conical or \\nstraight-sided glass measures are more accurate. \\nVery small volumes of liquid can be measured in \\ndrops (see Measuring Remedies, right).\\nStorage\\nDifferent preparations may be kept for varying \\nperiods of time before they begin to lose their \\nIdentification\\nBefore using medicinal plants that have been \\ncollected from the wild, it is essential that they be \\ncorrectly identified. If in doubt, do not use the herb. \\nThe wrong identification of herbs has led to many \\ncases of poisoning. Foxglove leaves (Digitalis purpurea, \\np. 202), for example, are often mistaken for comfrey \\n(Symphytum officinale, p. 138).\\nUtensils\\nUse glass, enamel, or stainless steel pots and pans, \\nwooden or steel knives and spatulas, and plastic \\nor nylon sieves. A wine press is useful for making \\ntinctures. Do not use aluminium utensils, as  \\nthis potentially toxic element is easily absorbed  \\nby herbs.\\nSterilization\\nAll utensils used to make herbal remedies should \\nbe sterilized for at least 30 minutes in a well-\\ndiluted sterilizing solution, such as the type used \\nfor a baby’s bottle. After soaking, rinse thoroughly \\nMaking Herbal Remedies\\nIn the past, medicinal herbs have been made into an extraordinary variety of \\nformulations—not only infusions, decoctions, and tinctures, but also \\npreparations such as oxymels and elixirs. The following pages give simple step-\\nby-step instructions on making common herbal preparations. Making most \\ntypes of herbal medicine is not difficult, but it can be time-consuming—if you lack \\ntime or equipment, buy ready-made remedies from an herbal supplier (see \\nBuying Herbal Medicines, p. 17).\\nMeasuring Remedies\\n1 ml = 20 drops\\n5 ml = 1 teaspoon\\n15 ml = 1 tablespoon\\n150 ml = 1 herbal cup\\n250 ml = 1 cup\\nNever exceed the quantity of herbs used or  \\nthe recommended dosage.

This is especially important in the \\ncase of German chamomile ( Chamomilla recutita , \\np. 77). Use a teapot, or place a lid or saucer over \\na cup if making a small quantity. Use water that has \\njust boiled. Popular herbal teas, such as German \\nchamomile, are often taken as much for their \\nrefreshing taste as for their medicinal value and \\ncan be safely consumed in quantities of up to 5 or \\n6 cups a day. Some herbs, however, such as yarrow \\n(Achillea millefolium, p. 56), are significantly stronger \\nand must be taken in less frequent doses. Other \\nherbs, such as feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium,  \\np. 140), are so strong that they are not suitable for \\nuse in infusions. Always check the recommended  \\ndosage and quantity of herb to use, as infusions \\nhave medicinal actions and can produce unwanted \\neffects at the wrong dosage.\\nDecoctions are generally made using roots,  \\nbark, and berries, but sometimes leaves and \\nflowers may be included. Add these more  \\ndelicate parts of a plant once the heat is turned  \\noff and the decoction has finished simmering  \\nand is beginning to cool. Then strain and use  \\nas required.\\nChinese Decoctions\\nIn traditional Chinese medicine, decoctions are  \\nthe main way in which herbal medicines are \\nprepared. Large quantities of herb are often used \\nto produce a highly concentrated liquid, or the \\ndecoction is further reduced so that there is  \\nonly 3/4 cup (200 ml) of liquid remaining. This \\nincreases the preparation’s concentration. This \\nprocess is useful for astringent barks such as \\nbabul (Acacia nilotica, p. 159) and common oak \\n(Quercus robur, p. 260), which may be used \\nexternally to tighten gums or wash weeping skin \\nrashes. (Do not take internally.)\\nPot Infusion\\nWarm the pot, then add the herb. \\nPour in water that has just \\nboiled, replace the lid, and \\ninfuse for 10 minutes. \\nStrain some of the \\ninfusion into a cup.  \\nA teaspoon of  \\nhoney may be  \\nadded if desired.\\nInfusions\\nAn infusion is the simplest way to prepare the more delicate aerial parts of \\nplants, especially leaves and flowers, for use as a medicine or as a revitalizing  \\nor relaxing drink. It is made in a similar way to tea, using either a single herb or  \\na combination of herbs, and may be drunk hot or cold.\\nDecoctions\\nRoots, bark, twigs, and berries usually require a more forceful treatment than \\nleaves or flowers to extract their medicinal constituents. A decoction involves \\nsimmering these tougher parts in boiling water. Fresh or dried plant material \\nmay be used and should be cut or broken into small pieces before decocting. \\nLike infusions, decoctions can be taken hot or cold.\\nStandard Quantity\\nCUP 1 tsp (2–3 g) dried or 2 tsp (4–6 g) fresh \\nherb (or mixture of herbs) to a cup of water \\n(this makes 1 dose)\\nPOT 20 g dried herb or 30 g fresh herb (or a \\nmixture of different herbs) to 2 cups (500 ml)  \\nof water \\nStandard Dosage\\nT ake 3–4 doses (2 cups/500 ml) each day.\\nStorage\\nStore in a covered jug in a refrigerator or cool \\nplace for up to 24 hours.\\nStandard Quantity\\n20 g dried or 40 g fresh herb (or mixture of \\nherbs) to 3 cups (750 ml) cold water, reduced  \\nto about 2 cups (500 ml) after simmering (this \\nmakes 3–4 doses) \\nStandard Dosage\\nT ake 3–4 doses (2 cups/500 ml) each day.\\nStorage\\nStore in a covered jug in a refrigerator or cool \\nplace for up to 48 hours.\\n2\\nStrain the liquid through a sieve into  \\na jug.

Wine can be added periodically to  \\nkeep the herbs covered, although, in time, this  \\nwill reduce the wine’s tonic effectiveness. If \\nexposed to the air, the herbs may get moldy, \\nmaking the remedy not only ineffective but unsafe \\nto take.\\nHerbal Wines\\nHerbal wines are made by fermenting the herb  \\nin the same way that wine is produced from \\ngrapes. With the correct equipment this is  \\na simple process, but fermentation alters the  \\nactivity of the herbs and tends to reduce their \\nmedicinal value.\\nA syrup is made with equal proportions of an \\nherbal infusion or decoction and honey or unre\\xad\\nfined sugar. When making an infusion or decoction \\nfor a syrup, it needs to be infused or simmered for \\nthe maximum time to optimize its medicinal \\naction. Infusions should be infused for 15 minutes \\nand decoctions should be simmered for 30 minutes. \\nPress the soaked herb through the strainer or sieve \\nto remove as much liquid as possible. Small amounts \\nof neat tincture can be added to the cooled syrup to \\nincrease its effectiveness. \\nSyrups Made with Tinctures\\nSyrups may also be made with tinctures instead of \\ninfusions or decoctions. Combine 500 g of honey \\nor unrefined sugar with 1 cup (250 ml) of water. \\nGently heat until all the sugar or honey has \\ndissolved and the mixture has thickened. Remove \\nfrom the heat. Once cool, stir 1 part of the \\ntincture, or mixture of tinctures, into 3 parts of the \\nsyrup and bottle as directed opposite.\\nTonic Wines\\nTonic wines are an agreeable way to take strengthening and tonic herbs to \\nincrease vitality and improve digestion. Neither strictly medicinal, nor simply \\nappealing to the palate, they are easy to prepare at home. Tonic wines are \\nmade by steeping tonic herbs, such as dong quai (Angelica sinensis, p. 63), or \\nbitter herbs, such as southernwood (Artemisia abrotanum, p. 172), in red or \\nwhite wine for several weeks.\\nSyrups\\nHoney and unrefined sugar are effective preservatives and can be combined \\nwith infusions or decoctions to make syrups and cordials. They have the \\nadditional benefit of having a soothing action, and therefore make a perfect \\nvehicle for cough mixtures as well as relieving sore throats. With their sweet \\ntaste, syrups can disguise the taste of unpalatable herbs and are therefore \\ngreatly appreciated by children. \\nStandard Quantity\\n100 g dried or 200 g fresh tonic herbs or  \\n25 g dried bitter herbs and 1 quart (1 liter) of \\nred or white wine\\nStandard Dosage\\nDrink 1/3 cup (70 ml) each day before a meal.\\nStorage\\nUse a ceramic vat with a tap at its base, or a \\nsterilized glass jar.

If only  \\nusing infused oils occasionally, make a smaller \\nquantity than the standard amount with the same \\nproportion of herb to oil. The wine press may be \\nreplaced with a jug—when cool enough to touch, \\nsqueeze the oil through the jelly bag as illustrated \\nin Cold Infused Oils below.\\n Many herbs make effective hot infused oils, \\nespecially spicy herbs such as ginger (Zingiber \\nofficinale, p. 155), cayenne (Capsicum frutescens,  \\np. 74), and pepper (Piper nigrum, p. 250). These oils \\ncan be rubbed into the skin to relieve rheumatic \\nand arthritic pain, improve local blood flow, and \\nrelax muscles. Other hot infused oils from leafy \\nherbs, such as comfrey (Symphytum officinale,  \\np. 138), speed wound healing. Oil infused with \\nmullein (Verbascum thapsus, p. 281) is used for \\nearache and ear infections, and chickweed (Stellaria \\nmedia, p. 272) ointment may be produced from  \\na hot infused oil (see p. 295). \\nCold Infused Oils\\nMaking a cold infused oil is a slow process and \\ninvolves leaving a jar packed with herbs and oil  \\nto stand for several weeks. Sunlight encourages \\nthe plant to release its active constituents into \\nthe oil. It is the most suitable method of oil \\ninfusion for fresh plant material, especially the \\nmore delicate parts, such as flowers. St. John’s \\nwort (Hypericum perforatum, p. 106), calendula \\n(Calendula officinalis, p. 73), and melilot (Melilotus \\nofficinalis, p. 234) are three of the most \\ncommonly produced cold infused oils. St. John’s \\nwort oil is anti-inflammatory and analgesic, and \\nmay be applied topically or taken internally (after \\nconsulting an herbalist) for peptic ulceration. \\n Olive oil is particularly suitable for cold \\ninfusion as it rarely turns rancid. The intensity \\nof sunlight and length of time an herb is infused \\naffects the concentration of its medicinal \\nconstituents. For greater strength, add the \\nextracted oil to a fresh supply of herbs and \\ninfuse again.\\nInfused Oils\\nInfusing an herb in oil allows its active, fat-soluble ingredients to be extracted; \\nhot infused oils are simmered, while cold infused oils are heated naturally by \\nthe sun. Both types of oil can be used externally as massage oils or added to \\ncreams and ointments. Infused oil should not be confused with essential oil, \\nwhich is an active constituent naturally present in a plant and has specific \\nmedicinal properties and a distinct aroma. Essential oil may be added to an \\ninfused oil to increase its medicinal efficacy.\\nStandard Quantity (infused oils)\\n250 g dried or 500 g fresh herb to 3 cups (750 \\nml) olive, sunflower, or other good-quality \\nvegetable oil \\nStorage\\nStore in sterilized, airtight, dark glass bottles  \\nfor up to 1 year; for the best results, use within  \\n6 months.\\n1\\nStir the chopped herb and oil together in a \\nglass bowl over a saucepan of boiling water. \\nCover and simmer gently for 2–3 hours.\\n2\\nRemove from the \\nheat and allow the \\nmixture to cool, then \\npour into the wine press \\n(or jug if not available) \\nwith a jelly bag in place. \\nCollect the strained oil in \\na jug, pressing all the \\nliquid out of the herb.\\n3\\nPour the infused oil \\ninto clean, dark \\nglass bottles, using a \\nfunnel.

The simplest \\nway to make a soft, all-purpose ointment is to use \\npetroleum jelly or soft paraffin wax (other methods \\nare explained below). Petroleum jelly is impermeable \\nto water and provides a protective barrier for the \\nskin. Single herbs or mixtures of herbs may be \\nused as required, provided they are finely cut, and \\nessential oil can be stirred into the ointment just \\nbefore straining.\\nDifferent Consistencies\\nA solid and relatively grease-free ointment will \\nspread easily and is useful for preparations such as \\nlip balms.

Cover and place in a \\nwarm oven for 3 hours, then remove, strain, and \\npour into jars. This ointment can also be made by \\ncombining 2 cups (500 ml) of hot infused oil (see \\np. 294) with 60 g of melted beeswax.\\nA poultice of self-heal ( Prunella vulgaris , p. 256) \\nrelieves sprains and fractures, while St. John’s wort \\n(Hypericum perforatum, p. 106) can help ease muscle \\nor nerve pains.\\nDrawing Boils & Infected Wounds\\nSlippery elm powder ( Ulmus rubra, p. 145)  \\nmixed with calendula ( Calendula officinalis , p. 73) \\ntincture or myrrh ( Commiphora molmol , p. 85) \\ntincture makes a useful poultice for drawing boils \\nand wounds.\\nOintments\\nOintments contain oils or fats heated with herbs and, unlike creams, contain no \\nwater. As a result, ointments form a separate layer on the surface of the skin. \\nThey protect against injury or inflammation of damaged skin and carry active \\nmedicinal constituents, such as essential oils, to the affected area. Ointments \\nare useful in conditions such as hemorrhoids or where protection is needed \\nfrom moisture, as in chapped lips and diaper rash.\\nPoultices\\nA poultice is a mixture of fresh, dried, or powdered herbs that is applied to an \\naffected area.

Most of the following \\npreparations provide localized relief. Steam inhalations, for example, help  \\nclear various respiratory complaints; gargles and mouthwashes soothe sore \\nthroats and mouth ulcers; massage oils can ease aching muscles; and skin \\nwashes relieve inflamed skin conditions.\\nSteam Inhalations\\nSteam inhalations are an effective way to clear \\ncongestion and relieve sinusitis, hay fever, and \\nbronchial asthma. The combination of steam and \\nantiseptic ingredients clears the airways \\nthroughout the respiratory system.\\nTo make Pour 1 quart of freshly boiled water into \\na large bowl, add 5 –10 drops of essen tial oil, and \\nstir well. Alternatively, make an infusion of 25 g of \\nherb to 1 quart of water, brew for 15 minutes, and \\npour into a bowl. Cover the head and bowl with a \\ntowel, close the eyes, and inhale the steam for \\nabout 10 minutes or until the preparation \\ncools. After a steam inhalation, it \\nis advisable to stay in a warm \\nroom for 15 minutes to allow \\nthe airways to adjust and \\nany congestion to clear. \\nGargles & Mouthwashes\\nGargles and mouthwashes usually contain astringent \\nherbs, which tighten the mucous membranes of the \\nmouth and throat. Astringent herbs such as rhatany \\n(Krameria triandra, p. 225) and myrrh (Commiphora \\nmolmol, p. 85), can be made more palatable and \\nmore effective for sore throats by adding a little \\nlicorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra , p. 101) or a pinch of \\ncayenne pepper (Capsicum frutescens, p. 74) to the \\npreparation. As gargles and mouthwashes are made \\nfrom infusions, decoctions, or diluted tinctures, they \\ncan generally be swallowed for internal treatment. \\nEnsure you do not exceed the daily internal dose  \\nof an herb.\\nTo make Make an infusion (see p. 291) but allow it \\nto stand for 15–20 minutes in order to increase its \\nastringency. Strain, then gargle, or rinse the mouth \\nwith a cupful. Alternatively, use a decoction (p. 291) \\nor dilute about 1 tsp (5 ml) of tincture in 1/3 cup \\n(100 ml) of hot water and use in the same way. \\nRepeat as often as required unless specified.\\nPessaries & Suppositories\\nPessaries and suppositories are waxy pellets \\ncontaining essential oil or fine powder. They are \\nused when oral medicine is likely to be broken \\ndown during digestion before reaching its intended \\nsite. Pessaries are inserted into the vagina and \\nsuppositories into the anus, where they melt at \\nbody temperature. The herb is quickly absorbed \\ninto the bloodstream, providing fast relief. It is best \\nto buy ready-made suppositories.\\nTo make pessaries Use a pessary mold or make 24 \\nmolds from cooking foil shaped around a  \\nthimble. Mix 10 g of soft soap, 2 tbsp plus 2 tsp  \\n(50 ml) of glycerine and 2 tbsp (40 ml) of \\nmethylated spirits and pour into the molds. Leave \\nfor a few minutes to coat the molds, then pour out \\nthe excess and leave to harden. Melt 20 g of cocoa \\nbutter, remove from the heat, and add 30 drops of \\nessential oil or 5 g of powder. Pour into the shells \\nand leave to set for 3 hours, before removing the \\npessaries. Store in a cool place in a pot lined with \\ngreaseproof paper for up to 3 months.\\nEssential Oils\\nEssential oils can be used in massage to soothe minor \\naches and pains. Before use, they should be diluted \\nwith a carrier oil as they can irritate the skin. Essential \\noils deteriorate rapidly after dilution, so it is best to \\nmix small quantities as you need them.\\nFor massage Mix 5–10 drops of essential oil with  \\n1 tbsp of carrier oil, such as wheatgerm \\nor almond oil, and massage gently into \\nthe skin.\\nOil burner Use 5–10 drops of neat \\nessential oil mixed with water. Burn  \\nfor 30 minutes.\\nBaths & Skin Washes\\nHerbal baths and skin washes can relieve many \\nconditions, including aching limbs and stuffy  \\nsinuses. They are made from diluted essential oils \\nor infusions. Eyebaths soothe sore, inflamed, or \\nirritated eyes.\\nTo make an herbal bath Add 2 cups (500 ml) of \\nstrained infusion (see p. 291) or 5–10 drops of \\nessential oil to a running bath.\\nTo make a skin wash Make an infusion, strain it, \\nand bathe the affected area.\\nTo make an eyebath Make a small quantity of an \\ninfusion or use an herbal teabag. Strain the liquid \\ncarefully into a sterilized eyebath. Alternatively, add \\n2 –3 drops of a tincture to an eyebath filled with \\nwater that has just boiled. Allow to cool and place \\nthe eyebath firmly over the eye. Tip the head back \\nand bathe the eye by continuously blinking. Repeat \\nup to 3 times a day.\\nGeneral cautions Eyebaths should be very weak, so as \\nnot to sting the eyes. Always use boiled, cooled water in a \\nsterilized container. Do not bathe eyes over a period of \\nmore than 2–3 weeks at a time. If bathing eyes frequently, \\nadd a tiny pinch of salt to each eyebath to counter \\nleaching of salts and minerals from the eye.\\nCold Macerations\\nHeat destroys the active constituents of some \\nherbs, and a cold maceration is more appropriate \\nthan a decoction. \\nTo make Pour 2 cups (500 ml) of cold water over \\n25 g of herb and leave to stand overnight. Strain \\nand use as you would a decoction\\nJuices\\nThe juices extracted from many herbs can be taken \\ninternally or applied externally.\\nTo make Pulp the plant, preferably using a \\nmechanical juicer. Otherwise use a food processor. \\nSqueeze the pulp through a jelly bag to collect the \\njuice. Some herbs need to be cooked in order to \\nextract their juice.\\nThe eyebath is applied to the affected eye and the head is \\ntilted well back.\\nInfusions made with \\nantiseptic herbs make \\nuseful gargles and \\nmouthwashes for sore \\nthroats and mouth ulcers.\\nEssential oils are \\nused in baths and \\noil burners, and in \\nmassage to relieve \\ntension and stress.\\nUS_296-297_Creams.indd   297 26/02/16   4:43 pm\\n'),\n",

Nevertheless, there are situations in which \\nherbal remedies can cause damage, and several \\nmedicinal herbs have been shown to interact with \\nconventional medicines. In very rare circumstances \\npeople have become seriously ill or have died from \\ntaking herbal medicines, though in almost every \\ncase the problem has resulted from one of the \\nfollowing safety factors being ignored. If at any time \\nyou think that you are reacting badly to an herbal \\nmedicine, stop taking it immediately, and contact a \\nqualified herbalist or naturopath, or your doctor.\\nHow Problems Can Occur\\nThe wrong herb is used due to mistaken \\nidentification. Usually, when herbs are bought over \\nthe counter you have no need to worry, as the \\nnecessary checks have been made to ensure it  \\nhas been correctly identified. If you are harvesting \\nUsing Herbal Remedies Safely\\nOne reason that herbal remedies are so popular is that plant medicines are \\nsafer and cause fewer side effects than conventional ones. However, herbal \\nremedies are not always safe, and—like medicines of every kind—they need  \\nto be used with care. \\nRagwort is a toxic plant and, \\nwith its yellow flowers, easily \\nmistaken for St. John’s wort.\\nDong quai has been shown \\nto thin the blood and is \\nknown to interact with \\nconventional anticoagulants \\nsuch as warfarin.\\nherbs from the wild, you must be certain  \\nwhat herb it is that you are collecting. For \\nexample, ragwort (Senecio jacobaea), which  \\nis very toxic to the liver, can easily be \\nmistaken for St. John’s wort (Hypericum \\nperforatum, p. 106): both grow in open \\nareas and produce clusters of bright \\nyellow flowers in the summer. In rare \\ncases, the physical act of picking certain \\nhighly toxic herbs could be dangerous,  \\nbecause absorption takes place across the skin. \\nHemlock (Conium maculatum, p. 194), for example, \\nis so toxic that serious side effects can result from \\nsimply handling the plant.\\nThe wrong part of an herb is used. It is important \\nto use the correct part of the herb. Sometimes \\none part of a plant is safe, while all other parts  \\nare poisonous. For example, while the potato \\ntuber (Solanum tuberosum, p. 271) makes good, \\nnutritious food, all other parts of the plant are \\nhighly toxic.\\nPoor-quality material is used or the herb has \\nbeen poorly prepared. If you are making up your \\nown remedy, follow the recommended methods \\nfor storage and preparation (see Harvesting & \\nProcessing, pp. 288–289). If buying over the counter, \\ncheck the section on Quality Control (see p. 17) for \\nadvice on purchasing good-quality products.\\nThe wrong herbal remedy is being used. Y ou can \\navoid this problem if you stick to using well-known \\nherbs and take them to treat the conditions for \\nwhich they are usually recommended. Ginger \\n(Zingiber officinale, p. 155) and sweet flag (Acorus \\ncalamus, p. 57) both help to relieve nausea and \\nindigestion, but ginger is an altogether safer \\nmedicine—it is better known, is a common \\ntreatment for motion and morning sickness, and, \\nunlike sweet flag, has no known side effects.\\nThe herbal remedy interacts with other \\nmedicines. Herbal remedies are medicines, so  \\nit should come as no surprise that conventional \\nmedicines can interact with them. Several herbs \\nare known to interact with conventional medicines. \\nSt. John’s wort, for example, speeds up the rate  \\nat which the liver breaks down a range of drugs, \\nincluding certain antibiotics, antiepileptics, and \\nimmune-suppressants. This reduces their \\neffectiveness within the body, and in extreme \\nsituations could threaten life. It is also inadvisable  \\nto take St. John’s wort at the same time as other \\nantidepressants. A number of herbs, notably  \\ndong quai (Angelica sinensis, p. 63), interact with \\nanticoagulant drugs, such as warfarin and \\nclopidogrel. These drugs are prescribed to prevent \\nblood clotting. Herbal products containing these \\nherbs will interact with anticoagulants and increase \\nthe risk of internal or external bleeding. Always tell \\nhealth-care professionals what medicines you are \\nusing—both herbal and conventional. If you are \\ntaking medicines prescribed by your doctor, it is \\nalways sensible to seek advice before starting to \\ntake herbal remedies. \\nThe herbal remedy causes an allergic reaction.  \\nBy and large, allergic reactions to herbs result from \\ntouching the herb (contact dermatitis) and from \\nbreathing in pollen or powdered herb (airborne \\nallergies). Some plants are well known for causing \\ncontact dermatitis—rue (Ruta graveolens, p. 265) \\nfor example—and should not be handled by those \\nprone to allergies. Some powdered herbs can \\nstimulate sneezing attacks in the sensitive—for \\nexample linden (Tilia spp., p. 277). In some cases, \\nherbal medicines may trigger allergic reactions \\nwithin the body. This kind of response is more \\nworrying, and if you are prone to allergies it is \\nadvisable to see a qualified herbalist before taking \\nall but the most common herbs.\\nOther treatment is needed. Sometimes herbal \\nmedicine is not the appropriate form of treatment. \\nIf you have an acute illness or injury, are seriously ill, \\nor do not recover as expected after taking an \\nherbal remedy, do not delay—seek professional \\nadvice or emergency treatment.\\nUS_298-299_Using_Herbal_Remedies_Safely.indd   298 17/03/16   4:01 pm'),\n",

The following remedies contain \\nrelaxing herbs that alleviate headaches triggered \\nby stress as well as other more specific factors. \\nLavender is soothing, while vervain is a tonic  \\nand relaxing herb for nervous exhaustion. \\nPeppermint is effective for headaches that are \\nlinked to indigestion.\\nMigraine is a more specific problem. The \\nremedies aim both to prevent the onset of a \\nmigraine as well as treat the symptoms.\\nHangovers are not a nerve problem in a direct \\nsense, but they should be treated in the same \\nway as any other type of mild poisoning that \\nrequires detoxification and headache relief.  \\nMake sure you also drink plenty of water.\\n QGeneral caution For migraine or recurrent \\nheadaches, consult a professional practitioner to  \\ndiagnose and treat the underlying cause.\\nDifficulty in sleeping affects everyone at one time \\nor another. Herbs can provide a safe and gentle \\nsolution to this problem. \\nSedative herbs such as German chamomile, \\nlinden, lavender, hops, and passionflower are \\nrelaxing and, unlike some herbs, are most likely \\nto be effective against insomnia when taken at \\nnight. Hops are excellent when the mind refuses \\nto “switch off.”\\nStimulant herbs  are effective when the \\nbody suffers from nervous exhaustion and  \\nfeels, paradoxically, too tired for sleep. Oats  \\nand ginseng encourage a good night’s sleep, \\nespecially for people suffering from nervous \\ntension and fatigue.\\nHerbal sleeping pills, containing \\ncombinations of valerian, hops, passionflower, \\nand similar herbs, are often helpful in \\novercoming mild sleep problems and in \\nreducing feelings of anxiety and stress.\\nGeneral Remedy\\nHerb Lavender (Lavandula officinalis, p. 108)\\nRemedy Rub a few drops of neat essential oil on \\nthe temples.\\nTension & Sinus Headaches\\nHerb Linden (Tilia spp., p. 277)\\nRemedy Make an infusion using 1 heaping tsp of \\nlinden to 3/4 cup (150 ml) of water, or use teabags. \\nDrink up to 3 cups (750 ml) a day.\\nNervous Exhaustion & Overactivity\\nHerbs Vervain (Verbena officinalis, p. 149), valerian \\n(Valeriana officinalis, p. 148)\\nRemedy Make an infusion of vervain and drink up \\nto 21/4 cups a day.

Many herbal medicines \\nare ideally suited to treating the health problems that begin when \\npeople reach their late fifties, such as circulatory problems, weak \\ndigestion, and poor memory. The herbs recommended here can \\nhelp to maintain good health, preventing or reducing the severity \\nof symptoms that are often accepted as an inevitable consequence \\nof aging. Self-treatment for other problems often experienced later in life, such \\nas arthritis, is suggested in earlier sections.\\nMaintaining Vitality\\nGeneral Conditions\\nGinseng\\n(Panax ginseng)\\nMany herbs help to maintain vitality.\\nThyme is a much underrated herb. Recent \\nresearch has discovered that it has antiaging  \\nand tonic properties that maintain vitality and \\nreduce the chance of catching colds, flu, and \\nother respiratory infections.\\nAshwagandha is a tonic, calming herb that \\nmay slow the aging process. It is particularly \\nsuited to aid recovery from long-term illness.\\nGinseng is well known as a remedy that \\nsupports vitality and resistance to stress and \\ninfection in older people.\\nRhodiola has similar tonic, restorative \\nproperties to ashwagandha and ginseng, but \\nenhances mental performance and has a mild \\nantidepressant activity.\\nConditions that arise through aging need patient, \\nlong-term treatment.\\nGinkgo is the oldest tree on the planet. Its \\nleaves maintain good circulation to the head and \\nbrain, improving memory, concentration, and \\nenergy levels. Evidence suggests it may reduce \\nthe risk of a stroke.\\nGotu kola has significant anti-inflammatory \\nactivity, for example in arthritis, but is also a tonic \\nthat helps to protect the nervous system and to \\nmaintain memory and cognition.\\nGarlic has great value as a long-term dietary \\nsupplement, helping to maintain healthy \\ncirculation, balance blood-sugar levels, reduce \\nhigh blood pressure and fat levels in the blood, \\nand improve resistance to infection, especially \\nbronchitis.\\nRehmannia, a Chinese tonic herb with \\nstrengthening and mildly stimulant properties, \\nappears to lower blood pressure and blood fat \\nlevels. It is suitable for people who have a weak \\nliver and metabolism.\\nGentian, a bitter herb, helps the absorption  \\nof food by maintaining digestive secretions, \\nwhich diminish with age.\\nGeneral Remedy\\nHerb Thyme (Thymus vulgaris, p. 143)\\nRemedy Make a standard infusion.  \\nT ake 11/4–12/3 cups (300–450 ml) a day.\\nStress or Convalescence\\nHerb Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera, p. 152) \\nRemedy T ake 1 g of the root 2–3 times a day, \\neither by chewing it or chopping it and mixing with \\na little water.\\nHerb Ginseng (Panax ginseng, p. 118)\\nRemedy T ake 1 g 1–2 times a day for up to  \\n3 months.

The herbalist will then recommend \\nappropriate treatment, usually involving an herbal \\nprescription, dietary advice, and a suggested  \\nexercise regimen. If you are already undergoing \\nconventional treatment, the herbalist will advise \\nyou on its compatibility with herbal medicine and,  \\nif necessary, devise a program to discontinue \\npharmaceutical medicines gradually.\\n Subsequent consultations generally last about  \\n30 minutes and are likely to take place every 4 to  \\n6 weeks for a period of 3 months. This, of course, \\nmay vary, depending on the nature of the treatment.\\nSafety of Herbs\\nAlthough herbal medicine is extremely safe, the \\nfact that it is natural does not necessarily mean it  \\nis harmless. The best guarantee against poor \\ntreatment is to consult a well-trained practitioner \\nwho belongs to a recognized professional association \\nand prescribes high-quality herbal medicines.\\nProfessional Training\\nTraditionally, herbalists learned their craft by \\napprenticeship. Nicholas Culpeper (1616–1654),  \\nfor example, was apprenticed to an apothecary for \\n10 years. Today, herbal practitioners are generally \\ntrained at a college or university, acquiring their \\nclinical skills in herbal and, in some cases, hospital \\nclinics. The curriculum typically includes an in-depth \\nstudy of medical sciences, such as physiology, \\npathology, pharmacology, and botany, as well as what \\ncan be called the herbal sciences, materia medica, \\nnutrition, and therapeutics. Modern training \\nattempts to honor and retain the best of traditional \\nherbal medicine, while incorporating the insights of \\ncontemporary medical science and research.\\nHerbalism Worldwide\\nWestern medical herbalism is the traditional form \\nof herbal medicine practiced in Britain. However, \\nthe Chinese and Ayurvedic traditions, among others, \\nare becoming more popular and are raising their \\nstandards of training. If you wish to consult a \\nChinese or Ayurvedic herbalist, it is strongly \\nrecommended that you select a member of the \\nassociations listed on this page.\\nWhat Does Herbal Medicine  \\nTreat Best?\\nIt is difficult to state exactly which ailments  \\nbest respond to herbal medicine, since almost  \\nno research has been undertaken with this \\nquestion in mind. Nevertheless, the experience  \\nof herbal practitioners and their patients suggests \\nthat many chronic and some acute illnesses readily \\nimprove with herbal medicine. Conditions that \\nare commonly treated by herbalists include  \\nallergies, arthritis, chronic or frequent infections,  \\ncirculatory problems, liver disease, menstrual and \\ngynecological problems, skin disorders, and stress-\\nrelated complaints such as headaches, insomnia,  \\nand palpitations.\\nChoosing a Practitioner\\nHerbal practitioners tend to treat ill health more \\neffectively as they gain greater experience. Anyone \\nwith a serious illness, such as rheumatoid arthritis \\nor cancer, should seek an experienced practitioner. \\nNevertheless, herbalists newly launched into \\npractice often bring a more flexible approach to \\ntreatment, having the time and enthusiasm for \\npatients that may be lacking in their more senior \\ncounterparts. That said, a trusting relationship is as \\nimportant as the treatment itself—always find a \\npractitioner in whom you feel confident. The best \\nway to find an herbalist is by recommendation, or \\nby looking on the websites of the herbal \\norganizations listed on this page.\\nThe Consultation\\nOn visiting an herbalist you should be made to feel \\nwelcome, receiving an attentive and sympathetic \\near. The first consultation takes about an hour, so \\nthere is ample time for the practitioner to gain a \\nrounded view of your health problems and life as  \\na whole.\\n Y ou will probably be asked about family traits, \\ndiet, lifestyle, levels of stress, and any particular \\nanxieties that you may have. If appropriate, a \\nphysical examination will take place, and the \\npractitioner will explain as far as possible what  \\nis wrong and how much improvement can be \\nexpected. Clinical tests may include urine analysis \\n The regulation of medical herbalism varies \\nconsiderably around the world. In the Far East, \\npractitioners and hospitals routinely offer herbal \\nmedicine, acupuncture, and other traditional \\nhealing practices alongside Western conventional \\nmedicine. In the U.S., the leading practitioner \\norganization is the American Herbalists Guild.\\n Herbal practitioners in continental Europe  \\nare known as phytotherapists, and are usually \\nconventional medical practitioners who have \\nstudied plant medicine at the postgraduate level. \\n In Australia, the National Herbalists’ Association \\nof Australia (NHAA) is the leading professional \\nbody of herbal practitioners.\\n In many parts of the world, herbal medicine is \\nunregulated. In this situation, it is wise to be \\ncautious and, as far as possible, to find a practitioner \\nbased on personal recommendation.\\nConsulting an Herbal Practitioner\\nMany common health problems, such as colds and indigestion, do not require  \\na professional consultation and can be successfully treated using herbs at home. \\nHowever, persistent or more serious ailments, such as stomach ulcers and \\nshingles, can be difficult or dangerous to treat on one’s own and need the \\nadvice and treatment of a qualified herbal practitioner or naturopath. \\nHerbal Practitioner Organizations \\nThis list is made up of recommended herbal \\npractitioner organizations active in the U.S.  \\nand Canada. \\nUNITED STATES\\nAmerican Herbalists Guild\\nwww.americanherbalistsguild.com\\nAmerican Association of  \\nNaturopathic Physicians\\nwww.naturopathic.org\\nNational Certification Commission for \\nAcupuncture and Oriental Medicine \\n(NCCAOM)\\nhttps://mx.nccaom.org/FindAPractitioner\\nNational Ayurvedic Medical Association\\nwww.ayurvedanama.org\\nCalifornia College of Ayurveda\\nwww.ayurvedacollege.com/resources/\\nAyurveda-practitioner-CAS\\nCANADA\\nThe Canadian Herbalist’s Association \\nof British Columbia\\nwww.chaofbc.ca\\nOntario Herbalists Association\\nwww.herbalists.on.ca\\nUS_320-321_Consulting_A_Herbal_Practitioner_Glossary.indd   320 17/03/16   4:01 pm'),\n",

It is an\\nancient natural wisdom of health and healing, a science of life. The aims and objectives\\nof this science are to maintain the health of a healthy person and to heal the disease of\\nan unhealthy person. Both prevention (maintenance of good health) and healing are\\ncarried out by entirely natural means.\\nAccording to Ayurveda, health is a perfect state of balance among the body’s three\\nfundamental energies, or \\ndoshas (vata, pitta, kapha)\\n and an equally vital balance among\\nbody, mind, and the soul or consciousness.\\nAyurveda is a profound science of living that encompasses the whole of life and\\nrelates the life of the individual to the life of the universe. It is a holistic system of\\nhealing in the truest sense. Body, mind, and consciousness are in constant interaction\\nand relationship with other people and the environment. In working to create health,\\nAyurveda takes into consideration these diʃerent levels of life and their\\ninterconnectedness.\\nAs a science of self-healing, Ayurveda encompasses diet and nutrition, lifestyle,\\nexercise, rest and relaxation, meditation, breathing exercises, and medicinal herbs, along\\nwith cleansing and rejuvenation programs for healing body, mind, and spirit. Numerous\\nadjunct therapies such as sound, color, and aromatherapy may also be employed. The\\npurpose of this book is to acquaint you with these natural methods, so you can make the\\nlifestyle choices and learn the self-healing modalities that are right for you in order to\\ncreate, maintain, or restore health and balance.\\nAyurveda\\n is a Sanskrit word that means “the science of life and longevity.” According\\nto this science, every individual is both a creation of cosmic energies and a unique\\nphenomenon, a unique personality. Ayurveda teaches that we all have a constitution,\\nwhich is our individual psychobiological makeup. From the moment of conception, this\\nindividual constitution is created by the universal energies of Space, Air, Fire, Water,\\nand Earth.\\nThese ɹve elements combine into the three fundamental energies, or \\ndoshas\\n. Ether\\nand air constitute vata, which is the energy of movement; ɹre and water constitute\\npitta, the principle of digestion or metabolism, the transformation of matter into energy;\\nand water and earth make up kapha, the energy of structure and lubrication. When the\\nmale sperm and the female egg join at the time of fertilization, the vata–pitta–kapha\\nfactors from the parents’ bodies that are most active and predominant at the moment,\\ndue to the season, the time, the emotional state, and the quality of their relationship,\\nform a new individual with a particular constellation of qualities.'),\n",

It is our own unique pattern of\\nenergy, our combination of physical, mental, and emotional characteristics and\\npredispositions.\\nThough the underlying structure of our \\nprakruti\\n remains a fixed reality, our home base\\nor essential individuality, it is constantly bombarded by numerous forces. Changes in\\nage and in our external environment, alternating heat and cold as the seasons pass, our\\nendlessly shifting thoughts, feelings, and emotions, and the quality and quantity of the\\nfood we eat continuously aʃect us. Unhealthy diet, excess stress, insuɽcient rest or\\nexercise, and repressed emotions all disturb our \\ndoshic\\n balance. Depending on the type\\nof changes and the individual’s underlying constitution, various ailments may develop:\\n• Some individuals experience an increase or aggravation of kapha, leading to\\nconditions such as colds, congestion, sneezing, and allergic manifestations, as well as\\nattachment, greed, and possessiveness.\\n• A pitta individual may become highly critical, angry, or perfectionistic, or may\\ndevelop physical symptoms such as acid indigestion, heartburn, diarrhea, dysentery,\\nhives, rash, or acne.\\n• Vata imbalances may manifest as constipation, abdominal distention, sciatica,\\narthritis, or insomnia, along with psychological symptoms such as fear, anxiety, and\\ninsecurity.\\nAll these illnesses and conditions, in addition to the countless others that lead to\\nhuman suʃering, are due to alterations in the body’s inner ecology. These upset the\\nindividual’s balance, creating subtle biochemical changes that ultimately lead to disease.\\nThis is why the Ayurvedic system of medicine speaks of the need for healing for every\\nindividual in every walk of life.\\nAs the internal and external conditions of our lives change, if we are going to remain\\nhealthy we need to constantly adjust in order to maintain equilibrium. Some of this\\nadjusting takes place automatically due to the beautiful wisdom and intelligence with\\nwhich our bodies have been designed. But much demands conscious choice.\\nTo maintain health and balance, we have \\nto juggle with the three doshas, taking\\naction to increase or decrease vata, pitta, or kapha as conditions demand. This requires\\nmoment-to-moment awareness, moment-to-moment consciousness, moment-to-moment\\nhealing.\\nThus healing—healthy, balanced, conscious living in the fullness of the present\\nmoment—is really a way of life. Ayurveda is not a passive form of therapy but rather\\nasks each individual to take responsibility for his or her own daily living. Through our\\ndiet, our relationships, our job, our numerous responsibilities, and our daily life as a\\nwhole, we can take simple actions for prevention, self-healing, wholeness, and growth'),\n",

Simply stated, that purpose is to know\\nor realize the Creator (Cosmic Consciousness) and to understand our relationship with\\nThat, which will entirely inɻuence our daily living. This great purpose is to be achieved\\nby balancing four fundamental aspects of life: \\ndharma\\n, which is duty or right action;\\nartha\\n, material success or wealth; \\nkama\\n, positive desire; and \\nmoksha\\n, spiritual liberation.\\nThese are called the four \\npurusharthas\\n, the four great aims or achievements in the life of\\nany individual.\\nThe foundation of all these facets of life is health. To maintain \\ndharma\\n and carry out\\nour duties and responsibilities to ourselves and others, we must be healthy. Likewise, in\\norder to create aʀuence and achieve success in action, good health is indispensable. To\\nhave creative, positive desire, we need a healthy mind and consciousness, a healthy\\nbody, and healthy perception. (Desire—\\nkama\\n—is sometimes translated as sex and refers\\nto progeny and family life, but it is really the positive energy or force of desire that\\ngenerates and propels any creative work.) And \\nmoksha\\n or spiritual liberation is nothing\\nbut perfect harmony of body, mind, and consciousness or soul. Thus the whole possibility\\nof achievement and fulfillment in life rests on good health.\\nIn the quarter century that I have been practicing medicine, I have worked in\\nsurgery, gynecology, obstetrics, and pediatrics, as well as in general medicine, treating\\nthousands of individuals in all stages and walks of life. I have repeatedly observed that\\nlifestyle choices, such as diet, exercise, and daily routine, can be a potent source of\\nhealing as well as a cause of disease. Many health problems seem intertwined with the\\nstresses of daily life, family and relationship problems, and worries about job and\\nmoney. Others are directly connected to eating the wrong kinds of food or getting too\\nmuch or too little exercise.\\nI have also grown more and more aware that illness provides us with an invitation\\nfor self-transformation, an opportunity to change our way of thinking, feeling, eating,\\nand in general caring for ourselves and our lives. It never ceases to amaze and delight\\nme how quickly and powerfully life can be set on the right track and balance restored\\nsimply through a proper diet, herbal medicines, meditation, an appropriate exercise\\nprogram, and other purely natural means.\\nThe remedies in this book come from my own practical clinical experience, based on\\nprinciples and practices developed over centuries. The tradition of Ayurveda extends\\nback over more than ɹve thousand years of continuous daily practice, from ancient\\ntimes to the present day. It is not a recently developed system of “alternative healing”\\nbut an enduring science of life that has never lost its integrity and essential nature. You\\ncan imagine how much wisdom it contains and how much practical knowledge it has\\naccumulated over a span of five millennia!\\nAbout three thousand years ago (around 900 \\nB.C\\n.), the long oral tradition of Ayurveda\\ntook new form when three great scholars—Charaka, Sushruta, and Vagbhata—wrote'),\n",

Both \\nPurusha\\n and \\nPrakruti\\n are eternal, timeless, and\\nimmeasurable.

Creation of this universe happens through their love. All of nature\\nis the child born from the womb of \\nPrakruti\\n, the Divine Mother.\\nIn the manifestation of nature from \\nPrakruti\\n, the ɹrst expression is \\nMahad\\n (or \\nMahat\\n),\\nintelligence or cosmic order. (In human beings, it is referred to as \\nBuddhi\\n, intellect.) Next\\nis \\nAhamkar\\n or ego, the sense of self-identity, the center in our consciousness from which\\nwe think, act, and react. \\nAhamkar\\n expresses itself in three universal qualities:\\nSattva\\n is stability, purity, wakefulness, essence, clarity, and light.\\nRajas\\n is dynamic movement and causes sensations, feelings, and emotions.'),\n",

Whatever is present in the cosmos, the same is present\\nin human beings. Man is a miniature of nature.\\nThe Five Elements: Building Blocks of Nature\\nThe concept of the ɹve elements is one of the most fundamental in Ayurvedic\\nscience. These ɹve elements (space, air, ɹre, water, and earth) exist in all matter, both\\norganic and inorganic. As man is a microcosm of nature, the ɹve elements also exist\\nwithin each individual. Our psychological tendencies, as well as our ɹve senses and the\\nvarious aspects of our body’s functioning, are all directly related to the five elements.\\nAccording to Ayurveda, the ɹve elements manifest sequentially, beginning with\\nspace, from the pure, uniɹed, unmanifested Cosmic Consciousness that is the source of\\nall.\\nSPACE\\nSometimes referred to as “ether,” space is empty, light, subtle, all-pervading,\\nomnipresent, and all-enclosing. It is universal, non-moving, and formless. Space is\\nnuclear energy. It appears when the pure unmanifest consciousness begins to vibrate\\nand is associated with sound and the sense of hearing. We need space in order to live,\\nmove, grow, and communicate. Spaces in the body include the mouth, nose,\\ngastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, abdomen, and thorax. Psychologically, space\\ngives freedom, peace, and expansion of consciousness and is responsible for love and\\ncompassion as well as feelings of separation, isolation, emptiness, ungroundedness,\\ninsecurity, anxiety, and fear.'),\n",

The principle of\\nmovement, air expresses itself in the movements of the muscles, the pulsations of the\\nheart, the expansion and contraction of the lungs.

Fire is active and\\nchangeable. In our solar system, the sun is the source of ɹre and light. In the body, our\\nbiological “ɹre” in the solar plexus regulates body temperature and metabolism:\\ndigestion, absorption, and assimilation. Fire is associated with light and with vision. Fire\\nis intelligence. It is necessary for transformation, attention, comprehension,\\nappreciation, recognition, and understanding. Fire is also responsible for anger, hatred,\\nenvy, criticism, ambition, and competitiveness.\\nWATER\\nThe next manifestation of consciousness, water is ɻuid, heavy, soft, viscous, cold,\\ndense, and cohesive. It brings molecules together. Water is chemical energy (it is the\\nuniversal chemical solvent). Water is associated with the sense of taste; without moisture\\nthe tongue cannot taste anything. Water exists in the body as plasma, cytoplasm, serum,\\nsaliva, nasal secretion, cerebrospinal ɻuid, urine, and sweat. It is necessary for nutrition\\nand to maintain life; without it, our cells could not survive. Water is contentment, love,\\nand compassion.

For health, and often for sheer survival, we have to continuously\\naccommodate ourselves to these changes, through what we eat, what we wear, where we\\nlive, and so on. This is a balancing act, playing elements against each other. We use\\nsolid earth to build homes, to protect ourselves against changes in air, heat (ɹre), and\\nwater. We use fire to prepare food (made of water and earth).\\nThe Three Doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha\\nThese ɹve great elements combine into three basic energies or functional principles,\\nwhich are present, in varying degrees, in everything and everybody. Space (ether) and\\nair constitute vata. Fire and water combine to make up pitta.

When in balance, they\\ncreate health. When out of balance, they are the cause of disease.\\nThese three doshas are responsible for the huge variety of individual diʃerences and\\npreferences, and they inɻuence all we are and all we do, from our choices of food to our\\nmodes of relating to others. They govern the biological and psychological processes of\\nour body, mind, and consciousness. They regulate the creation, maintenance, and\\ndestruction of bodily tissue, and the elimination of waste products. They also govern our\\nemotions. When in balance, they generate noble qualities such as understanding,\\ncompassion, and love. When their balance is disturbed by stress, improper diet,\\nenvironmental conditions or other factors, they can give rise to negative emotions such\\nas anger, fear, and greed.\\nIn Ayurveda, vata is the bodily air principle. It is the energy of movement. Pitta is\\nthe principle of ɹre, the energy of digestion and metabolism. And kapha is the principle\\nof water, the energy of lubrication and structure.\\nAll people have all of these three doshas, but one of them is usually primary, one\\nsecondary, and the third least prominent. Thus, each person has a particular pattern of\\nenergy, an individual combination of physical, mental, and emotional characteristics\\nthat make up his or her constitution (\\nprakruti\\n).

That ɻow of intelligence is\\nnecessary for communication between two cells, and it maintains the life function of\\nboth. On a cosmic level, \\nprana\\n is said to be the attraction between \\nPurusha\\n and \\nPrakruti\\n.\\nAs the principle of mobility, vata regulates all activity in the body, both mental and\\nphysiological. It is responsible for breathing, the blinking of our eyes, the beating of our\\nhearts, and all movement in the cytoplasm and cell membranes. All the impulses in the\\nvast networks of our nervous system are governed by vata.\\nWhen vata is in balance, it promotes creativity and ɻexibility and evokes feelings of\\nfreshness, lightness, happiness, and joy. Out of balance, vata produces fear,\\nnervousness, anxiety, even tremors and spasms.\\nVata is dry, light, cold, subtle, clear, mobile, and dispersing. We shall soon see how\\nthese qualities are expressed in a person with a vata constitution.\\nPITTA\\nPitta is translated as ɹre, but this is not meant literally. Rather, it is the \\nprinciple\\n of\\nɹre, the energy of heating or metabolism. Pitta governs all the biochemical changes that\\ntake place within our bodies, regulating digestion, absorption, assimilation, and body\\ntemperature.

Out-of-balance pitta\\nmay arouse fiery emotions such as frustration, anger, hatred, criticism, and jealousy.\\nPitta is hot, sharp, light, oily, liquid, pungent, sour, and spreading. These qualities\\noccur in various ways in people of pitta constitution.\\nKAPHA\\nKapha combines water and earth. It is the energy that forms the body’s structure, the\\nglue that holds the cells together. Kapha also supplies the liquid needed for the life of\\nour cells and bodily systems. It lubricates our joints, moisturizes the skin, helps to heal\\nwounds, and maintains immunity. Kapha provides strength, vigor, and stability.\\nPsychologically, excess kapha is responsible for the emotions of attachment, greed,\\nlust, and envy. When kapha is in balance it expresses itself in tendencies toward love,\\ncalmness, and forgiveness.\\nThe qualities of kapha include heavy, slow, cool, oily, damp, smooth, soft, static,\\nviscous, and sweet. Kapha individuals display these qualities in various ways.\\nTogether, these three doshas govern all the body’s metabolic activities. Kapha\\npromotes anabolism, the process of building up the body, the growth and creation of\\nnew cells as well as cell repair. Pitta regulates metabolism, which is digestion and\\nabsorption. Vata triggers catabolism, the necessary deterioration process in which larger\\nmolecules are broken down into smaller ones.\\nVata, the principle of movement, moves both pitta and kapha, which are immobile.\\nThus when vata is out of balance, it inɻuences and disturbs the other doshas. The\\nmajority of illnesses have aggravated vata at their source.\\nThe whole of life’s journey is divided into three major milestones. From birth to age\\n16 is the kapha age. From 16 to 50 is the age of pitta, and from 50 to 100 the age of\\nvata.\\nIn childhood, kapha and the process of anabolism are predominant, as this is the\\ntime of greatest physical growth and the structuring of the body. Kapha disorders, such\\nas lung congestion, cough, colds, and mucus secretions, are common at this time. In\\nadulthood, a time of activity and vitality, pitta is most apparent. Vata and the catabolic\\nprocesses of deterioration take over in old age, bringing vata disorders such as tremors,\\nemaciation, breathlessness, arthritis, and loss of memory.\\nThe Twenty Qualities: An Important Key to Healing'),\n",

Ayurveda delineates twenty fundamental\\nqualities, which appear in ten pairs:\\nThe Twenty Basic Attributes or Qualities\\nHeavy—Light\\nOily—Dry\\nStable—Mobile\\nSlimy—Rough\\nGross—Subtle\\nCold—Hot\\nSlow—Sharp\\nSoft—Hard\\nDense—Liquid\\nCloudy—Clear\\nThese qualities are found both in the world around us and in our bodies. Today’s\\nweather may feel light or heavy, and it may be liquid or dry, mobile (windy) or stable,\\nhot or cold, cloudy or clear. Food we eat can partake of any of these qualities. Ice\\ncream, for example, is heavy, oily, cold, soft, and liquid. Our skin may be oily or dry,\\nrough or smooth. Our moods, too, can be heavy or light, cloudy or clear; our thinking\\nmay be slow or sharp, our mind quiet and stable or mobile and hyperactive, clear or\\ncloudy.\\nWe are constantly aʃected by changes in these qualities. Cold, windy, clear, dry\\nweather aggravates vata dosha and may lead to colds and any number of vata ailments\\nsuch as insomnia, constipation, or arthritis. Hot, humid weather aggravates pitta and\\nmay lead to outbreaks of irritation and anger as well as physical complaints like acne,\\neczema, or skin rashes. Cloudy, gray, humid or rainy weather can aggravate kapha,\\nleading to colds and coughs, depression, lethargy, overeating and oversleeping, and\\nweight gain.\\nEach of these paired qualities represents the extreme on a continuum. The two\\nqualities in each pair inɻuence or aʃect one another according to two fundamental\\nprinciples of Ayurveda:\\n1. Like increases like.\\n2. Opposites decrease each other.\\nThese principles are a key to healing with Ayurveda. When an imbalance has\\nmanifested, \\nsuccessful treatment requires increasing opposite qualities\\n.

These simple\\nremedies immediately make sense when we hear them because they are so natural.\\nAyurvedic physicians have carefully observed nature and located these qualities\\nwithin all things, both organic and inorganic. Ayurvedic treatment consists to a great\\nextent of identifying a person’s disorder in terms of these qualities, and setting right any\\nimbalances.\\nHow is this done? Speaking in very general terms, excessive dryness in the body—\\nconstipation, dry skin, emaciation, and so on—is frequently associated with aggravated\\nvata; excessive heat—burning urine, irritated eyes, fever, inɻammation, anger, or a\\ncritical attitude—with aggravated pitta; and undue heaviness—lethargy, overweight,\\ncongestion, and excess mucus—with unbalanced kapha.

Thus, ten vata individuals, or ten kapha-pitta individuals,\\nwill have ten diʃerent temperaments, ten unique sets of qualities and characteristics.\\nMaintaining our individual qualitative and quantitative proportion of the doshas is our\\nchallenge if we are to remain healthy. When we maintain this proportion our health is\\ngood, but when the balance is upset, disease may result.\\nPrakruti and Vikruti\\nAt the time of conception, each person’s combination and proportion of vata, pitta,\\nand kapha is determined according to the genetics, diet, lifestyle, and current emotions\\nof the parents. As mentioned in the Introduction, the doshas predominant in the parents\\ncombine to form the constitution of the new life they are creating.\\nIf, for example, the father is pitta predominant and the mother vata predominant,\\nand the pitta factor is stronger than the vata, and the union is taking place on a hot\\nsummer \\nnight after eating a spicy meal, then the baby that is born will have a\\nconstitution that is pitta predominant. Or if both parents are kapha, and they have a\\nkaphagenic diet and are making love in kapha season, then their child will have a\\npredominance of kapha dosha.\\nA few fortunate individuals are born with a constitution in which all three doshas are\\nequally present, which gives them the likelihood of exceptionally good health and a long\\nlife span, but most of us have one or two doshas predominant.'),\n",

Your \\nprakruti\\n may, for example, be predominantly\\npitta, with vata secondary and a little kapha. (This can be written as V\\n2\\nP\\n3\\nK\\n1\\n.)

If your vata or kapha should\\nincrease, moving toward an equal proportion of the doshas, it would not be healthy for\\nyou.\\nAs conditions change—due to weather, dietary choices, fatigue, stress, emotional\\nstate, exercise or lack of it—the balance of the doshas in our mind-body system also\\nchanges. This altered state of the doshas, reɻecting the current state of our health, is\\ncalled our \\nvikruti\\n. If your health is excellent, your current doshic status will be the same\\nas your \\nprakruti\\n. But more likely there will be a discrepancy, and it is this diʃerence\\nbetween the two that gives a direction for healing. Your aim will be to reestablish the\\nbalance indicated by your \\nprakruti\\n.\\nI know you are eager to ɹnd out what your constitution is, so let’s move on to that.\\nAfterward, we will look more deeply into the characteristics of each doshic type.\\nHow to Determine Your Constitutional Type\\nThe chart on \\nthis page\\n to \\nthis page\\n is a self-assessment that will enable you to\\ndetermine your unique constitution according to Ayurveda.\\nPlease remember that this can provide only a rough guideline.

(You might want to photocopy it, to\\nhave it available for others or for future use.) First, base your choices on what is most\\nconsistently \\ntrue about your life as a whole, over many years. This indicates your\\nprakruti\\n. Then ɹll it out a second time, considering how you have been feeling recently,\\nin the last month or two. This is your \\nvikruti\\n or present condition.\\nIt often helps to have a spouse or good friend verify your answers, as they may have\\ngood insights and some objectivity to offer as you make your responses.\\nAfter ɹlling out the chart, add up the number of marks under vata, pitta, and kapha'),\n",

Their veins and\\nmuscles are often quite prominent.\\nVatas generally have dry skin tending toward roughness. Their circulation is poor,\\nwith the result that their hands and feet are often cold. Because vata dosha is cold, dry,\\nlight, and mobile and people with a vata constitution tend to lack insulating material\\n(the fatty tissue under the skin), they are uncomfortable in cold weather, especially if it\\nis dry and windy, and they much prefer spring and summer.\\nThese individuals have a variable appetite and thirst and variable digestive strength.\\nThey are often attracted to astringent food such as salads and vegetables, but their\\nbodies actually need sweet, sour, and salty tastes. (We will discuss the eʃect of tastes in\\nchapter 8\\n.) Raw vegetables increase, rather than balance, vata. Vata individuals often\\nexperience digestive diɽculties and problems with absorption of nutrients. They tend to\\nproduce scanty urine, and their feces are hard, dry, and small in size and quantity.\\nConstipation is one of their most common ailments.\\nVatas are the most likely of the body types to fast or to eat very little, but this\\nactually increases vata and tends toward imbalance.\\nOther physical characteristics typical of vata types include small, recessed eyes,\\nwhich are often quite lusterless; dry, thin hair, often curly or kinky; dry, rough skin and\\nnails; cracking, popping joints; and teeth that may be irregular, broken, or protruding.\\nVatas walk quickly and are always in a rush. Due to the mobile quality of vata, they\\ndo not like sitting idle but prefer constant activity. They also like to do a lot of\\ntraveling. Not doing anything is a punishment for them. They are attracted to jogging,\\njumping, and vigorous physical activity, but because they tend to have less stamina,\\nthey can easily get strained or overtired.'),\n",

What can\\nwe do to maintain a positive state of health and avoid getting sick?\\nThese are questions that the ɹve-thousand-year-old tradition of Ayurvedic medicine\\nhas considered in depth. The answers, drawn from deep insight and generations of\\npractical experience, can help us prevent illness from developing and heal it if it arises.\\nLet’s begin by examining the Ayurvedic understanding of health. Then we will look\\nat ten potential causes of illness and how you can counteract them. Once you are aware\\nof the factors that can either maintain health or disturb your body’s equilibrium and set\\nthe disease process in motion, you can organize your life for health and balance. Finally,\\nwe will consider the Ayurvedic understanding of how illness develops, from its earliest,\\ninvisible stages until it is fully grown.\\nThe Definition of Health\\nAccording to Ayurveda, health is not simply the absence of disease. It is rather a state\\nof balance among body, mind, and consciousness.\\nHealth consists of a balanced state of the three humors (doshas), the seven\\ntissues \\n(dhatus)\\n, the three wastes \\n(malas)\\n, and the gastric ɹre (agni), together\\nwith the clarity and balance of the senses, mind, and spirit.\\nAlthough you will not need to master all these terms and considerations in order to\\neffectively use the remedies in \\nPart III\\n, an acquaintance with them will give you a bigger\\npicture of the depth and practicality of this science.\\nYou are already familiar with the three doshas, the biological humors or principles\\nthat govern all activity in the body: \\nvata, the energy or principle of movement; pitta,\\nthe energy of digestion and metabolism; and kapha, the principle of lubrication and\\nstructure. Balance of the three doshas maintains health; imbalance leads to disease.\\nThe \\ndhatus\\n are the basic bodily tissues. They are responsible for the entire structure of\\nthe body and the functioning of the diʃerent organs and systems. Crucial to the\\ndevelopment and nourishment of the body, the \\ndhatus\\n unfold successively as follows,\\nstarting with the nourishment derived from the product of digestion:\\n1\\n. \\nRasa\\n (plasma or cytoplasm) contains nutrients from digested food and subsequently'),\n",

If the raw materials of digestion are\\ninadequate, or if there is a problem in any stage, each successive \\ndhatu\\n will not receive\\nthe nourishment it needs and the respective tissues or organ systems will suʃer. So for\\ngood health, all seven \\ndhatus\\n must develop and function properly.\\nThe three waste products \\n(malas)\\n are feces, urine, and sweat. The body must be able\\nto produce these in appropriate amounts, and to eliminate them through their respective\\nchannels.\\nAgni is the biological ɹre or heat energy that governs metabolism. It can be equated\\nwith the digestive enzymes and metabolic processes involved in breaking down,\\ndigesting, absorbing, and assimilating our food. Agni maintains the nutrition of the\\ntissues and the strength of the immune system. It destroys microorganisms, foreign\\nbacteria, and toxins in the stomach and intestines. It is an extremely vital factor in\\nmaintaining good health.\\nAgni sustains life and vitality. An individual endowed with adequate agni lives long\\nand has excellent health. But when agni becomes impaired because of an imbalance in\\nthe doshas, metabolism is adversely aʃected. The body’s resistance and immunity are\\nimpaired, and the person begins to feel unwell. When this vital ɹre is extinguished,\\ndeath soon follows.\\nIn addition to these bodily factors, the senses, mind, and spirit also play a vital role\\nin maintaining good health, as we will discuss in the next section. When all these factors\\nare balanced, it produces a state called \\nswastha\\n, which means “totally happy within\\noneself.”\\nAgni\\nThere is a saying in Ayurveda that a person is as old as his or her agni.\\nAccording to the \\nCharaka Samhita\\n, one of the great classics of Ayurvedic medicine:'),\n",

Proper nourishment of the body, \\ndhatus, ojas\\n, etc.,\\ndepends upon the proper functioning of agni in digestion.\\n“The five types of agni, corresponding to ether, air, fire, water, and earth, digest\\nthe respective components of the food.… In this way, balanced agni cooks the\\nappropriately chosen and timely consumed food, and leads to promotion of health.\\n…\\n“Agni is necessary for the normal process of digestion, and the subtle energy of\\nagni\\n transforms the lifeless molecules of food, water, and air into the consciousness\\nof the cell.”\\nThis state of happiness and balance can be created and sustained by maintaining a\\nhealthy lifestyle in accordance with nature and the requirements of your own\\nconstitution. Proper nutrition, proper exercise, healthy relationships, positive emotions,\\nand a regulated daily routine all contribute to a healthy life.

These causative factors upset the balance of\\nthe doshas, weaken agni and the \\ndhatus\\n, and lead to poor health.\\nTen Factors in Health and Illness\\nIllness does not suddenly appear. There is a direct causal link between the factors\\nthat inɻuence us and the eʃects they produce. The \\ncause is the concealed eʃect, and the\\neffect is the revealed cause\\n. The cause is like a seed, in which the as-yet-unmanifested tree\\nis concealed. The tree is the expressed value of the seed. Health is the eʃect of a healthy\\nlifestyle and healthy habits; disease is the “tree” sprouted from unhealthy habits.\\nAccording to the \\nCharaka Samhita\\n,\\nBoth the patient and the patient’s environment need to be examined in order\\nto arrive at an understanding of the disease and the causes of disease. It is\\nimportant to know where the patient was born and raised, and the time of onset\\nof the imbalance. It is also important to know the climate, customs, common\\nlocal diseases, diet, habits, likes and dislikes, strength, mental condition, etc.\\nThis enumeration opens the door to the wide variety of factors constantly inɻuencing\\nour health. Let us consider some of them.\\nLIKE INCREASES LIKE'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf', 'page': 42}, page_content='The ɹrst important principle in considering the potential causes of disease is “Like\\nincreases like.” A dosha is increased by experiences and inɻuences (such as food,\\nweather, and seasons) with qualities similar to it. Dry foods, dry fruit, running, jogging,\\njumping, always being in a rush, and working too hard are all factors that aggravate\\nvata in the system. Pittagenic factors, such as hot spicy food, citrus fruit, fermented\\nfood, and hot humid weather, provoke excess pitta. Cold, cloudy, damp weather, eating\\ndairy products, wheat, and meat, and sitting and doing nothing increase kapha.\\nThe antidote to “like increases like” is “opposite qualities decrease or balance.” This\\nis the key to healing.\\nNOTE\\n: In general, one’s \\nprakruti\\n indicates one’s disease proneness. Individuals\\nof pitta constitution, for example, tend to have pitta diseases. But this is not\\ninevitable. A person of vata constitution who eats a lot of hot spicy food, drinks\\nalcohol, lies in the sun, smokes cigarettes, and represses anger will deɹnitely get\\na pitta disease. If he or she eats candy, cookies, ice cream, and other dairy\\nproducts and is exposed to cold weather, there will be a susceptibility to\\ncongestive kapha disorders.\\nFOOD AND DIET\\nWe have already touched on the eʃects of food on the doshas, and \\nchapter 8\\n will\\ndiscuss this important topic in depth, so we won’t go into it at length here. The principle\\nis simply that eating the right kinds of food for your \\nprakruti\\n maintains vitality and\\nbalance, while eating the wrong kinds creates imbalance in the doshas, the ɹrst step in\\nthe genesis of disease.\\nEating spicy food or sour or citrus fruit and drinking alcohol all increase heat and\\nacidity in the body, something a pitta person cannot aʃord. For a vata individual, dried\\nfruits, beans (including garbanzo, pinto, and aduki) are hard to digest and will provoke\\nvata. Raw salads, which are cold and astringent, will likewise increase vata. For a\\nkapha individual, dairy products, cold drinks, and fatty fried foods deɹnitely add to\\nkapha. So a vata person eating a vatagenic diet, a pitta person eating a pitta-provoking\\ndiet, and a kapha person eating kapha-aggravating food are deɹnitely creating\\nimbalance and sowing the seeds for ill health.\\nWrong food combinations (see table \\nthis page\\n), stale food, food with chemical\\nadditives, and wrong eating habits, such as eating too much late at night or eating in a\\nrush, also contribute to imbalance and lead to poor digestion and poor health. Diet is\\nthus one of the main potential causes of ill health—but by understanding these\\nprinciples and eating according to the guidelines for our constitutional type, it is also\\none of the major ways we can take control of our lives and maintain healthy balance.\\nSEASONS'),\n",

The predominant dosha of\\nthe season will tend to build up at that time and can cause aggravation especially in\\nsomeone of the same \\nprakruti\\n. If we act intelligently, we can avoid this accumulation and\\naggravation.\\nFor example, because autumn and early winter tend to increase vata, individuals\\nwith a vata-predominant constitution need to eat warm foods, dress warmly, avoid cold\\nfood and drinks, and stay out of nasty weather. Otherwise they will fall prey to vata\\nillnesses and discomforts, such as constipation, insomnia, and lower back pain. If pitta\\nindividuals want to remain free of anger, as well as hives, rash, and diarrhea, they need\\nto keep cool in the summer, avoiding spicy foods, overexertion, and overexposure to the\\nhot sun. Kaphas need care in the heart of winter and early spring if they are going to\\navoid colds, coughs, allergies, and sinus congestion in the damp, cool, heavy weather.\\nWe will look further at the seasons, their eʃects, and how we can best live in\\nharmony with their rhythms and changes in \\nchapter 5\\n, where we discuss the ideal\\nAyurvedic lifestyle, including daily and seasonal routines.\\nEXERCISE\\nExercise is another factor that can profoundly inɻuence your health for better or\\nworse. Regular exercise improves circulation and increases strength, stamina, and\\nimmunity. It helps one to relax and to sleep peacefully. It benefits the heart and lungs, is\\nvital for eʃective digestion and elimination, and helps the body purify itself of toxins\\nthrough sweating and deep breathing. Exercise increases the rate of combustion of\\ncalories, so it is good for maintaining body weight and for weight loss.

At each stage, certain diseases and types of disease are more common. Childhood\\nis the age of kapha. Children’s bodies are growing and building up their structure, so\\nkapha dosha is more predominant. Their bodies are soft and gentle (qualities of kapha),\\nthey require more sleep than adults, and they are susceptible to kapha illnesses such as\\ncolds and congestion.\\nAdulthood exhibits more characteristics of pitta. Adults are more competitive,\\naggressive, and ambitious than children; they work hard, they require less sleep, and\\nthey fall prey to pitta-type disorders such as gastritis, colitis, and peptic ulcers.\\nOld age is the age of vata. Elderly people sleep quite a bit less, and their sleep is\\nbroken. They tend to get constipation, cracking and popping of joints, degenerative\\ndiseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer’s disease, and suʃer from\\nforgetfulness, all characteristic of vata dosha.\\nThis shows that our age and stage of life are factors that have to be considered in the\\nchoices we make to keep our doshas in balance and remain healthy. Elderly people, for\\nexample, should not engage in strenuous exercise, and if possible they should minimize\\ntravel, among many factors that increase vata. They should favor a vata-balancing diet,\\nwith more warm, moist foods, more oil, and less salad and dried fruit.\\nMENTAL AND EMOTIONAL FACTORS\\nOur life is a whole, consisting of body, mind, and pure consciousness.

Fear, anger, grief, hatred, envy, possessiveness, and other negative emotions\\ndisturb our doshic balance; likewise, when the doshas are already out of balance, they\\nmay give rise to these same negative emotions.\\n• Increased vata is associated with anxiety, insecurity, fear, nervousness, restlessness,\\nconfusion, grief, and sadness.\\n• \\nIncreased pitta\\n is associated with anger, envy, hate, ambition, competitiveness,\\ncriticism, judgmental attitude, sharp speech, perfectionism, and the need to be in\\ncontrol.\\n• \\nIncreased kapha\\n is associated with greed, attachment, possessiveness, boredom,\\nlaziness, and lethargy.\\nEmotions have an aɽnity with certain organs: grief and sadness with the lungs,\\nanger with the liver, and hatred with the gall bladder.

Through ordinary\\nexperience our senses of taste, touch, smell, sight, and hearing can nourish us, and we\\ncan also ɹnd healing through sense therapies such as aromatherapy, color therapy,\\nmantras and other healing sounds, massage, and the tastes in herbs and foods.\\nBut because all our perceptions, as well as \\nour thoughts and feelings, are biochemical\\nevents as well as experiences in consciousness, improper use of the senses can create\\nimbalance or damage in the body and result in illness.\\nOveruse\\n of the senses strains and stresses our nervous system. To use a simple\\nexample, repeated exposure to bright light hurts the retina and strains the optic nerve,\\nwhich triggers pitta, and sooner or later a person’s eyesight will be aʃected or neuritis-\\nlike symptoms will arise. If we listen to loud music or hear loud sounds, the eardrum and\\nthe rest of our hearing apparatus are hurt and weakened; if it occurs often, the person\\ncan become deaf. Loud sounds also aʃect systemic vata dosha, giving rise to vata\\nsymptoms such as arthritis or degenerative changes in the bones. Lying in the sun strains\\nthe sense of touch, aggravates pitta, and may lead to skin cancer.\\nMisuse\\n of the senses means using them in a wrong way, such as trying to read very\\nsmall letters, or looking through a microscope or telescope (which creates a strain on the\\neyes), or reading while lying down (which changes the angle of focus and builds up\\nstress on the muscles of the eyeball), which will eventually result in pitta or vata\\ndisorders. Eating a large quantity of wrong food, such as hot, spicy, stimulating food\\ncontaining cayenne pepper, is a misuse of the taste organ. Listening to loud sounds over\\nthe telephone, and long phone conversations, both aggravate vata. Exposing the senses\\nto wrong inputs, such as watching violent movies on television, is also a misuse of the\\nsenses.\\nUnderuse\\n of the senses means not perceiving with total attention, ignoring what we\\nperceive, or not making full use of our wonderful sensory equipment.

Don’t judge the other person or\\nyourself. When your spouse says something and you feel hurt or angry, look inside to see\\nwhat your thoughts and feelings are saying to you. Be honest. Out of honesty, clarity\\ncomes.\\nWhen clarity is lacking, feelings are repressed, or communication is absent at times\\nof crisis in our relationships, stress builds up, and this is one of the causes of illness.\\nStress disrupts our inner biochemistry, the doshas are thrown out of balance, and the\\nseeds of disease are sown.\\nHusband and wife, brother and sister, parent and child—all our relationships must be\\nabsolutely clear.

This is true even of such apparently\\nuncontrollable factors as the seasons and the weather: if it is cold, you can dress\\nwarmly; if it is hot, you can take it easy and stay out of the sun.\\nHow Disease Develops\\nAccording to Ayurveda, illness is the end result of a long process that can be detected\\nand addressed at any stage. This process has been thoroughly studied and its phases\\ndelineated in great detail.\\nThe disease process begins with disturbances in the balance of the doshas. Temporary\\nimbalances are common and quite normal; problems arise if the aggravated condition is\\nnot corrected. In the normal course of events, vata, pitta, and kapha go through cycles\\nof change in three stages: accumulation, provocation or aggravation, and paciɹcation.\\nPitta, for example, begins to build up and accumulate in the late spring. It is provoked\\nor aggravated in the hot summer months, and it naturally becomes paciɹed when the\\nweather cools down in the autumn.\\nIf the increased dosha isn’t paciɹed naturally through a change in seasons, it\\nundergoes further changes and disease may result. If a person with a predominantly\\nvata constitution experiences some degree of increased vata in the fall due to the cool,\\ndry, windy weather, but it returns to normal soon after, disease will not develop. The\\nperson can aid the process of restoring balance, for example, by eating moist, warming\\nfoods and dressing warmly in the windy weather.\\nHow to Transform Negative Feelings\\nNegative feelings can cause hurt both to ourselves and to others. If we express\\nanger or criticism, for example, we inɻict pain on someone else. On the other hand,\\nrepressing such feelings creates problems for ourselves, as the stressful biochemistry\\naffects the internal organs and systems down to the cellular level.\\nIf both expressing and holding back negative feelings can be harmful, what shall\\nwe do when these emotions boil up in us? Ayurveda oʃers a way to learn from such\\nsituations and resolve them in a positive manner.\\nAt the moment the feeling comes up, look into it. Let’s suppose it is a feeling of\\nanger. Take a long, deep breath, let yourself feel the anger, and exhale it out. Give\\nthe feeling total freedom to express itself \\nwithin you\\n, so that you look at it honestly\\nand feel it. Breathe into it, surrender to it, and be with it. Breathe into it, and\\nbreathe out. Soon it will dissolve by itself.'),\n",

When awareness goes both ways, outer and inner, understanding is total. This\\napproach doesn’t put a scar on the mind.\\nLook at the feeling—any feeling or emotion—without labeling it or naming it.\\nThen the observer and the observed become one. Observe with total awareness,\\nwith no division between subject and object, no separation between yourself and\\nthe feeling. Give freedom to the feeling; let it flower; let it fade away.\\nIf the condition of aggravated vata continues, vata will move into the general\\ncirculation and into the deep connective tissue, where it will generate pathological\\nchanges. Disease will develop. Imbalance is disorder, and disorder is disease.\\nDisease is like a child. It has its own creation within the womb of the body, according\\nto a process known as \\nsamprapti\\n or pathogenesis, literally “the birth of pain.” In brief,\\nthis is how it happens:\\n1. ACCUMULATION\\nDue to various causes, such as diet, weather, seasons, emotions, and others we have\\ndiscussed, the doshas begin to accumulate in their respective sites: vata in the colon,\\npitta in the intestines, and kapha in the stomach. This is the easiest stage at which to\\ntreat any incipient health problem. A trained Ayurvedic physician can feel the\\nimbalance \\nin your pulse even at this stage, and you may be able to detect it yourself.\\nVata accumulation may be experienced as constipation, abdominal distension, or\\ngases in the colon. Pitta buildup may be felt as heat around the belly button area and\\ncan be observed as a slightly yellowish discoloration in the whites of the eyes, or dark\\nyellow-colored urine. The person will be very hungry and will crave candy and sugar.\\nAccumulated kapha leads to feelings of heaviness, lethargy, and loss of appetite.\\nAt this stage the individual is still quite healthy, and when a dosha starts to build up,\\nthe body’s intelligence creates an aversion to the causal factor and a craving for\\nopposite qualities, which can restore balance. For example, if you’ve eaten ice cream\\nthree days in a row and kapha is building up, the thought of more ice cream will not be\\nappealing; rather, your body will crave cayenne pepper or other spicy food to burn up\\nthe kapha and counteract it. One should listen to this wisdom and not continue\\nincreasing the cause.\\n2. AGGRAVATION\\nThe accumulated dosha continues to build up in its own site. The stomach gets\\nbrimmed up with kapha, the intestines ɹll with pitta, or the colon overɻows with vata.'),\n",

Kapha tries to go up into\\nthe lungs, pitta tries to move into the stomach and gallbladder, and vata tries to move\\ninto the flanks.\\nYou can feel this stage, too. For example, if you eat too much kapha food on\\nSaturday night, you might feel full when you wake up on Sunday and think to yourself,\\n“Maybe I should fast or eat very lightly today.” But then someone invites you out for\\nSunday brunch, and you eat heavily again. The next day you might get a cough or a\\nfeeling of congestion in the lungs as the kapha starts to move upward. Excess pitta in\\nthe second stage may cause heartburn or acid indigestion, even nausea. Vata rising up\\nmay cause pain in the flanks or midback, or even breathlessness.\\nAccording to Ayurvedic therapeutics, the disease process can be addressed at any\\nstage, but speciɹc treatments are needed for speciɹc stages. In these ɹrst two stages,\\none can reverse the process by oneself, using common sense to apply the principle of\\nopposite qualities, and taking some home remedies. Once the disease process has gone\\nbeyond the gastrointestinal tract and entered the third phase, it is no longer under one’s\\nown control, and trained medical help is needed. (See \\nsidebar\\n on ama.)\\n3. SPREAD\\nThe dosha begins to spread from its place of origin, overɻowing into the bloodstream\\nand the general circulation of the body, “looking” for a place to enter. Here the disease\\nprocess has progressed to the point where eliminating the causal factor will not be\\nenough. A \\npanchakarma\\n puriɹcation program (or a similar cleansing regimen) is needed\\nin order to return the doshas to their respective sites in the gastrointestinal tract so they\\ncan be excreted from the body.\\nAma, Agni, and the Disease Process\\nThe body’s biological ɹre, which governs the transformation of matter into\\nenergy, is of thirteen major types. The central ɹre, called \\njatharagni\\n, governs the\\ndigestion and assimilation of food. The other agnis (the ɹre component in the cells,\\ntissues, and organs) perform the local process of digestion and nutrition. When agni\\nis robust and healthy, then whatever a person eats, the system digests, assimilates,\\nand absorbs it, then eliminates the impurities. But when the doshas are aggravated\\nbecause of poor diet, an unhealthy lifestyle, or negative emotions, they ɹrst aʃect\\nagni, which becomes unbalanced. When agni becomes weakened or disturbed, food\\nis not properly digested.\\nThe undigested, unabsorbed food particles accumulate in the gastrointestinal\\ntract and other subtle sites in the body and turn into a toxic, sticky, foul-smelling\\nsubstance called \\nama\\n. (Ama may also be formed by bacterial invasion and cellular\\nmetabolic waste.) In the third (“spread”) stage of the disease process, ama'),\n",

An isolated cell is a lonely cell, and a lonely cell is a confused cell.\\nPathological changes begin to occur. But the root cause of cytopathological changes\\nis the movement of these molecules of ama. So the ama has to be eliminated from\\nthe body by \\npanchakarma\\n or other means. (See “\\nTechniques for Cleansing and\\nPurification\\n” in \\nchapter 4\\n.)\\n4. DEPOSITION OR INFILTRATION\\nThe aggravated dosha enters an organ, tissue, or system that is weak or defective,\\ndue to previous trauma, genetic predisposition, accumulated emotional stress, repressed\\nemotions, or other factors. These weak areas in the body can be described as negative\\nlocations, like potholes in the road. Smoking cigarettes, for example, creates weakness\\nin the lungs; eating too much sugar creates weakness in the pancreas and blood tissue,\\nand so on.\\nThe newly arrived, aggravated humor (dosha) creates confusion within the cellular\\nintelligence of the weaker tissue and overwhelms it, changing its normal qualities and\\nfunctions. The quality of the aggravated dosha suppresses the normal qualities of the\\ntissue and combines with it, creating an \\naltered state, changed in structure and function.\\nIn this way, the “seeds” of disease begin to sprout.\\nUp to this point, the disease has not appeared on the surface, but it can be detected\\nby a skilled physician or recognized by imbalances in the doshas such as those\\nmentioned above. An alert person can feel subtle changes in the body. If the condition is\\nnot interrupted at this stage, it will erupt as a full-blown disease.\\n5. MANIFESTATION\\nIn this stage, qualitative changes become apparent. The signs and symptoms of an\\nactual disease appear on the surface; the person becomes sick. Whether in the lungs,\\nkidneys, liver, joints, heart, brain, or wherever, the seeds of disease now sprout and\\nbegin to manifest in the area of the defective tissue.\\n6.

This is also the stage it which the disease, now fully developed,\\nis therefore most difficult to treat.\\nIn the ɹfth stage, for example, when aggravated pitta dosha is invading the wall of\\nthe stomach, it may manifest as an ulcer.

That is why prevention is emphasized so strongly in Ayurveda. It is\\nmuch more effective to treat the illness in its seed stage, before it sprouts and grows.\\nBoth health and disease are processes. Disease is a process of abnormal movement of\\nthe doshas, while health is a process of their normal functioning. The wise person\\nunderstands that the normal rhythm and quality of the process can be reestablished by\\nchanging diet and lifestyle and avoiding the etiological factors that cause disease.\\nThe key is awareness.

But staying well is far easier than curing an illness,\\nespecially once an imbalance has progressed through the later stages of the disease\\nprocess. That is why prevention is so strongly emphasized in Ayurvedic medicine. In this\\nchapter we will consider some of the fundamental principles and approaches\\nrecommended by Ayurveda for remaining healthy.\\nAwareness\\nThe master key to remaining healthy is \\nawareness\\n. If you know your constitution, and\\nyou can remain alert to how your mind, body, and emotions respond to the changing\\nconditions in your environment and the numerous facets of your daily life, such as the\\nfood you eat, you can make informed choices to maintain good health.\\nAs we saw in \\nchapter 3\\n, the cause is the concealed eʃect and the eʃect is the\\nrevealed cause, as the seed contains the potential tree and the tree reveals the potency\\nof the seed. To treat the cause is to treat the eʃect, to prevent it from coming to fruition.\\nIf a kapha person always has kapha problems in the spring season, such as hay fever,\\ncolds, congestion, sinus headaches, and weight gain, such a person should watch his diet\\nand eliminate kapha-producing food like wheat, watermelon, cucumber, yogurt, cheese,\\ncandy, ice cream, and cold drinks. (Ice is not good for a kapha person; it will produce\\ncongestive disorders.)\\nThe knowledge of the causes of disease, and the understanding that “like increases\\nlike” and “opposites balance,” give us all the information we need to maintain or restore\\nour health, simply through conscious attention, moment-to-moment awareness of our\\nbehavior.\\nIf I am living consciously, I may observe that after I ate yogurt two weeks ago, I felt\\ncongested and a cold developed. Then it cleared up and I was okay for a few days.\\nWhen yogurt comes my way again, the memory will come up and my body will say,\\n“Hey, last time you ate yogurt, you got sick!” If I bring lively awareness and listen to my\\nbody, it will tell me, “I don’t want yogurt.” To listen to the body’s wisdom, the body’s\\nintelligence, is to be aware, and this is one of the most effective ways to prevent disease.\\nDeveloping an awareness of the potential causes of imbalance, and of one’s moment-\\nto-moment state of well-being, is the necessary ɹrst step to maintaining health. The'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf', 'page': 55}, page_content='second step is taking action.\\nTaking Action to Modify the Cause\\nYou can’t control the weather, but you can dress properly, so that cold winds, or\\nrain, or summer’s heat will not aggravate the doshas. Changes in the weather are a\\npotential cause of doshic imbalance. Windy, cold, dry weather will aggravate vata\\ndosha; hot, sticky weather is sure to provoke pitta; cold, cloudy, wet weather will\\nincrease kapha dosha. Once we have knowledge and understanding, it is time to take\\naction. Put on a hat, a scarf, a warm coat; stay out of direct sunlight. Modify the cause.\\nPotential causes of illness and imbalance are constantly arising, both within us and\\non the outside. The weather is changing, our surroundings are changing, our thoughts\\nand feelings are changing, and stressful situations are coming and going. In response to\\nthese changes, we have to act skillfully. As the Bhagavad Gita says, “Skill in action is\\ncalled \\nyoga\\n.”\\nI have to be smart enough to know my previous history and to learn from it. When I\\neat garbanzos, I get a stomachache, so \\nthis\\n time I should not eat them. Or if there is\\nnothing to eat except garbanzos, then I can add cumin powder, ghee, and a little\\nmustard seed, and it will be suitable for me to eat. The garbanzos’ dry, light vatagenic\\neffect will be modified by the moist, oily ghee and the warming spices.\\nA substantial part of the Ayurvedic pharmacy is the Ayurvedic art of cooking. Adding\\nspeciɹc seasonings changes the property of food and can cause a “forbidden” food, one\\nthat might have provoked imbalance, to become acceptable. Some people, for example,\\nare sensitive to potatoes. Potatoes give them gas and little aches and pains in the\\nmuscles and around the joints. But if they peel oʃ the skin and sauté the potato with\\nghee and a little turmeric, mustard seed, cumin powder, and cilantro, it mitigates the\\nvata-provoking property of the potato and the body can then handle it. One can take\\naction to modify the cause; the body’s response will be diʃerent, and that particular\\ncausative factor will not have an adverse effect.\\nThis principle applies equally well to psychological factors. You may know that\\nwatching violent movies upsets you and \\ngives you nightmares. The violent imagery\\ndisturbs your doshic balance, provoking anxiety and fear. You have observed this\\nhappening to you; the next time you are confronted with the “opportunity” to subject\\nyourself to a violent movie, you can just say no.\\nIt keeps coming down to the same central issue: consciousness, awareness, ɹnding\\nout, “What is my role in this situation? What do I know? What can I do?”\\nRestoring Balance'),\n",

The second step is taking\\naction to modify causes you can’t avoid or control (such as the weather). The next step is\\nto restore balance once it begins to be lost. The main method for doing this is to apply\\nthe opposite quality or qualities.\\nIf you’re cold, have some hot soup or take something warm to drink. If you’re\\nagitated or upset (perhaps you watched that violent movie against your better\\njudgment), sit down and do some meditation to calm your mind and emotions. If your\\npitta has been provoked and you’re feeling hot under the collar, take a swim or have\\nsome sweet cooling fruit.\\nThis principle seems so simple and makes such good sense that it is easy to overlook\\nit in practical daily life. But it is extremely powerful and eʃective. If you apply it, you\\nwill find that you can quickly and effortlessly restore balance to your mind and body.\\nTechniques for Cleansing and Purification\\nNow we have to consider still another level of self-healing. What if you haven’t taken\\nthe opportunity to develop awareness, to modify the cause, or to apply opposite\\nqualities to restore balance, and you have begun to get sick? What to do now?\\nThe principle of opposites is almost universally valid and helpful at any stage of\\ndisease. But once disease has begun to develop, it will not be suɽcient. At this stage it\\nbecomes necessary to use techniques for cleansing and purifying your body of excess\\ndoshas and accumulated toxins.\\nAs we have seen, when the doshas are aggravated because of poor diet, unhealthy\\nlifestyle, negative emotions, or other factors, they ɹrst aʃect agni (the body’s biological\\nɹre, which governs digestion and assimilation). When agni becomes weakened or\\ndisturbed, food is not properly digested. The undigested, unabsorbed food particles\\naccumulate in the gastrointestinal tract and turn into the toxic, sticky substance called\\nama. In the third (“spread”) stage of the disease process, ama clogs the intestines,\\noverɻows through other bodily channels such as the blood vessels, and inɹltrates the\\nbodily tissues, causing disease.\\nAma is thus the root cause of disease. The presence of ama in the system can be felt\\nas fatigue, or a feeling of heaviness. It may induce constipation, indigestion, gas, and\\ndiarrhea, or it may generate bad breath, a bad taste in the mouth, stiʃness in the body,\\nor mental confusion. Ama can most \\neasily be detected as a thick coating on the tongue.\\nAccording to Ayurveda, disease is actually a crisis of ama, in which the body seeks to\\neliminate the accumulated toxicity. Thus the key to prevention of disease—once ama has\\nbegun to build up—is to help the body eliminate the toxins.\\nTo remove ama from the system, Ayurveda employs many internal cleansing'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf', 'page': 57}, page_content='programs. One of these, most widely known in the West, is a ɹve-procedure program\\nknown as \\npanchakarma\\n (“ɹve actions”). The \\npanchakarma\\n programs used at Ayurvedic\\ntreatment centers include prepuriɹcation methods to prepare the body to let go of the\\ntoxins, followed by the purification methods themselves.\\nThe ɹrst preparatory step is internal oleation. The patient is asked to drink a\\nspeciɹc, small quantity of ghee (clariɹed butter) every day for several days. The ghee\\ncreates a thin ɹlm in the body’s channels that lubricates them, allowing the ama lodged\\nin the deep connective tissues to move freely, without sticking to the channels, to the\\ngastrointestinal tract for elimination. Internal oleation is done for three to ɹve days or\\neven longer, depending on the individual circumstances.\\nThis is followed by external oleation in the form of oil massage (\\nsnehana\\n) and\\nsweating (\\nswedana\\n). Oil is applied to the entire body with a particular kind of massage\\nthat helps the toxins move toward the gastrointestinal tract. The massage also softens\\nboth the superɹcial and deep tissues, helping to relieve stress and to nourish the nervous\\nsystem. Then the individual is given a steam bath, which further loosens the toxins and\\nincreases their movement toward the gastrointestinal tract.\\nAfter three to seven days of these procedures, the doshas will have become well\\n“ripened.” At this point the physician will determine that the patient is ready to\\neliminate the aggravated doshas and accumulated ama. One of the ɹve \\nkarmas\\n or\\nactions is selected as the most expedient route to eliminate the excess doshas. These\\nprocedures may include:\\n• therapeutic vomiting (\\nvamana\\n) to remove toxins and excess kapha from the\\nstomach;\\n• purgation or laxative therapy (\\nvirechana\\n) to help remove ama and excess pitta from\\nthe small intestines, colon, kidneys, stomach, liver, and spleen;\\n• medicated enema therapy (\\nbasti\\n) to help remove excess vata from the colon.\\nAggravated vata is one of the main etiological factors in the manifestation of diseases. If\\nwe can control vata through the use of \\nbastis\\n, we have gone a long way toward\\neliminating the cause of the vast majority of diseases.\\n• \\nnasya\\n or nasal administration of medication, in which dry herbal powders or oils\\nsuch as ghee are inserted into the nose to help remove accumulated doshas in the head,\\nsinus, and throat areas, and to clear up breathing.\\n• \\nrakta moksha\\n, puriɹcation of the blood, which is traditionally done in one of two\\nways. Bloodletting, in which a small amount of blood is extracted from a vein, is one\\nmethod, though it is illegal in the United States and is therefore not available here. The\\nsecond way is to cleanse the blood using blood-purifying herbs such as burdock.\\nPanchakarma\\n is not the only method used by Ayurveda to remove ama from the body.\\nDepending on the individual’s strength and the seriousness of the disease, one of two\\nmain approaches will be employed.

If the patient\\nhas more strength and energy and the illness is not so complicated or serious, then\\npanchakarma\\n is appropriate.\\nIMPORTANT NOTE\\n: \\nPanchakarma\\n is a special, powerful procedure requiring guidance\\nfrom a properly trained medical staʃ, not just someone with a modest amount of\\nAyurvedic training. It is performed individually for each person, with his or her\\nspeciɹc constitution and medical condition in mind, and it requires close\\nobservation and supervision at every stage, including post-\\npanchakarma\\n support.\\nShould You Use Ghee?\\nThe use of ghee for internal oleation is recommended for most people. However,\\nindividuals with high blood levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and sugar should not use it.\\nSo before you begin your home treatment, see a doctor and have your blood tested for\\nthese factors\\n.\\nIf they are within the normal range, there is no problem. If they are high, then\\ninstead of ghee use ɻaxseed oil, which provides eʃective oleation and also contains\\nfatty acids, which help to reduce cholesterol levels.\\nTake 2 tablespoons of the ɻaxseed oil three times a day for three days, ɹfteen\\nminutes before eating.\\nA Simple Home Purification\\nBoth for periodic prevention (to reverse any buildup of ama) and to deal with a\\nspeciɹc health problem, \\npanchakarma\\n is a highly recommended art of cleansing and\\ndetoxiɹcation. If you are not near a center where \\npanchakarma\\n is available under the\\nsupervision of a trained Ayurvedic physician, you can do an eʃective puriɹcation\\nprogram at home.\\nBegin your home detoxiɹcation program with internal oleation. For three days in a\\nrow, take about 2 ounces of warmed, liqueɹed ghee early in the morning. (See \\nappendix\\n2\\n for instructions on making ghee.) For a vata person, take the ghee with a pinch of\\nrock salt. For a pitta individual, take the 2 ounces of ghee plain. The kapha individual\\nshould add to the ghee just a pinch of \\ntrikatu\\n (a mixture of equal amounts of ginger,\\nblack pepper, and \\npippali\\n, or Indian long pepper).\\nThe ghee provides internal oleation and lubrication, which is necessary so that the\\nama or toxins begin to come back from the deep tissue to the gastrointestinal tract for\\nelimination.'),\n",

It is the sense of self in the cell that maintains the size\\nand shape of the cell. Self-esteem, self-conɹdence, and self-respect promote cellular\\nintelligence, which is necessary for proper cell function and immunity.\\nModern science is just now acknowledging the importance of the mind-body\\nconnection, but knowledge of it has been part of Ayurveda for ɹve thousand years.

A regulated daily routine\\nputs us in harmony with nature’s rhythms. It establishes balance in our constitution and\\nhelps to regularize our biological clock. It indirectly aids in digestion, absorption, and\\nassimilation of food, and it generates self-esteem, discipline, peace, happiness, and long\\nlife.\\nWaking up too early or too late, undisciplined eating, staying up too late, job stress,\\nand untimely bowel movements are a few habits that can unsettle us. Regularity in\\nsleeping, waking, eating, and eliminating, indeed following a regular daily routine,\\nbrings discipline to life and helps maintain the integrity of the doshas.\\nOur body is a clock. Or rather, it is several clocks at once. According to Ayurveda,\\nevery organ has a deɹnite time of maximum functioning. Morning time is the lung time.\\nMidday is stomach time, when we feel hungry. Afternoon is liver time, and late\\nafternoon is when the colon and kidneys operate at their peak.\\nThis biological clock works in conjunction with the doshic clock. Morning and\\nevening (dawn and dusk) are the times when the inɻuence of vata is greatest. In the\\nearly morning, from about 2 \\nA.M\\n. to sunrise, vata creates movement and people awaken\\nand tend to excrete waste. Again in the late afternoon, from about 2 \\nP.M\\n. until sunset, the\\ninfluence of vata makes one feel light and active.\\nEarly morning and evening are kapha times. From sunrise until about 10 \\nA.M\\n., kapha\\nmakes one feel fresh but a little heavy. Then again in the evening, from about 6 \\nP.M\\n. until\\naround 10, kapha ushers in a period of cooling air, inertia, and declining energy.\\nMidday and midnight are pitta times. At midmorning, kapha slowly merges into\\npitta, and by noon one feels hungry and ready for lunch. Again from 10 \\nP.M\\n. until around\\n2 \\nA.M\\n., pitta is at its peak, and food is digested.\\nThus there is a daily cycle of vata–pitta–kapha:\\n6 \\nA.M\\n.–10 \\nA.M\\n. = kapha\\n10 \\nA.M\\n.–2 \\nP.M\\n. = pitta\\n2 \\nP.M\\n.–6 \\nP.M\\n. = vata\\n6 \\nP.M\\n.–10 \\nP.M\\n. = kapha\\n10 \\nP.M\\n.–2 \\nA.M\\n. = pitta'),\n",

This daily routine\\nis the art of bringing harmony between the biological and doshic clocks and\\nchronological time.

At this time of the morning, pure\\nqualities are lively in nature, which can bring freshness to the doors of perception and\\npeace of mind.\\nIdeally, vata people should get up at about 6 \\nA.M\\n., pitta people by 5:30, and kapha\\npeople by 4:30.

Thus the main recommendation\\nfor everyone, especially for individuals whose \\nprakruti\\n is primarily pitta, is to keep cool\\nand not allow pitta dosha to become aggravated.\\n• In the morning, as part of your daily routine, rub 5 to 6 ounces of coconut oil or\\nsunɻower oil on your body before bathing. Coconut oil is calming, cooling, and soothing\\nto the skin.\\n• Wear cotton or silk clothing; it is cooling, \\nlight, and allows the skin to breathe.\\nLoose-fitting clothes are best; they permit the air to pass through and cool the body.\\n• The best colors to wear in hot weather are white, gray, blue, purple, and green.\\nAvoid red, orange, dark yellow, and black, which absorb and retain heat and will\\naggravate pitta.\\n• Follow the pitta-pacifying diet from the food guidelines in \\nchapter 8\\n. Good fruits for\\nsummer include apples, pears, melons, plums, and prunes. Watermelon and lime juice\\nare also good in summer. Try steamed asparagus, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cucumber\\nraita, and basmati rice. Kitchari made of basmati rice and mung dal, with a little ghee\\nand grated coconut, makes a delicious light meal. Avoid sour fruits, citrus fruits, and\\neven beets and carrots, which are all heating. Garlic, onion, chili, tomato, sour cream,\\nand salted cheeses are also not recommended. You can eat more salads in summer than\\nat any other time, as they are cooling, but they are best eaten for lunch. If you eat meat,\\nyou can have some light meat—chicken, turkey, or shrimp—once a week. Avoid dark\\nmeats, which are heating.\\n• Don’t drink hot water or hot drinks in the summer. Room-temperature or cool\\ndrinks are best. Ice and iced drinks, however, inhibit digestion and create toxins (ama)\\nin the body; it is best never to drink them.\\n• A refreshing drink is cool lassi.

A\\ncup of hot water with a teaspoon of honey helps balance kapha during the spring\\nseason. (But never cook honey; it clogs the subtle channels and acts as a toxin in the\\nsystem.)

It is the constant\\nmovement of awareness. \\nPrana\\n carries awareness to the object of our\\nperception; that movement of awareness through \\nprana\\n is called attention. The internal\\nmovement of \\nprana\\n is the movement of sensation, thought, feeling, and emotion. Thus\\nprana\\n and mind are deeply connected.\\nThe physical manifestation of \\nprana\\n is breath. Breathing and mind are closely\\nconnected. Ayurveda says that breathing is the physical part of thinking and thinking is\\nthe psychological part of breathing. Every thought changes the rhythm of breath, and\\nevery breath changes the rhythm of thinking. When one is happy, blissful, and silent,\\nbreathing is rhythmic. If one is disturbed with anxiety, fear, or nervousness, the\\nbreathing is irregular and interrupted.\\nAncient Vedic seers (\\nrishis\\n) discovered this intimate relationship between breathing\\nand mental activity and uncovered the art of \\npranayama. Pranayama\\n equals \\nprana\\n plus\\nayam. Ayam\\n means “to control,” \\nprana\\n is “breath.” By controlling the breath, we can\\ncontrol mental activity.\\nThe Secret of Pranayama\\nThe \\nrishis\\n also found an intimate relationship between the right and the left breath\\ncycle. You may have noticed that sometimes you breathe more easily through the left\\nnostril, and sometimes your breathing shifts more to the right nostril. This shift happens\\nabout every 45 to 90 minutes. Just as the right side of our body is governed by the left\\nside of the brain and vice versa, breathing better through the left nostril activates the\\nright hemisphere of the brain, and breathing better through the right nostril activates the\\nleft brain.\\nThe left brain is associated with male energy, the right with female energy. The left\\nbrain is for logical thinking, investigation, inquiry, aggressiveness, competition, and\\njudgment. Whenever we are judging, investigating, and so on, our right breath cycle is\\ndominant and our left brain hemisphere is operating. Exactly opposite, when the right\\nhemisphere is acting and the left breath cycle is working, we have female energy, which\\nis associated with love, compassion, intuition, art, poetry, and religion. So when an\\nartist is drawing a picture or a poet writing a poem, he or she is using some part of the\\nright brain. And when the scientist is working in the lab, investigating and solving a\\nproblem, at that time he or she is using some part of the left brain.'),\n",

So whatever\\ntechnique you do, whatever system you follow, according to the instruction given by\\nyour teacher, please do that.\\nBut what is meditation, and what is not?\\nMeditation is not concentration.

But\\nnot in meditation.\\nIn concentration we build a wall of resistance, and in the eʃort to control the mind,\\nwe lose energy. Some people meditate that way for an hour, and when they’re ɹnished,\\nthey feel tired, because for that hour they were ɹghting and ɹghting, negating\\neverything, saying no to all thoughts and perceptions, trying to focus the mind.\\nConcentration is all-exclusive, but meditation is all-inclusive. Meditation is open,\\nchoiceless awareness. Everything is welcome. Meditation says yes to everything, while\\nconcentration says no to everything.\\nConcentration is eʃort. Wherever there is eʃort, there is a maker of the eʃort. The\\nmaker of the eʃort is the ego. Concentration nourishes the ego, the maker of the eʃort.\\nThe more the concentration, the more ego.\\nIn meditation, there is no eʃort and no \\neʃort-maker. Therefore there is freedom. You\\nare just sitting quietly and listening to everything, whether it is the call of a bird, the cry\\nof a child, the rustle of the leaves. Every sound is welcome. Whatever the sound, allow it\\nto come to you. When you listen to the sound, you become the center and the sound is\\nperipheral, rushing toward you, to meet with you.\\nIn listening to any kind of sound without judgment, without criticism, without liking\\nor disliking, you become the center and all sounds rush toward you, to dissolve into you.\\nFollow the sound.

Health-\\nconscious people today are interested in the role good nourishment can play in their\\nhealing and in their health. Many have come to realize that proper food and diet can\\nmake a vital contribution to good health, while inappropriate eating is often responsible\\nfor poor health, lack of vitality, and susceptibility to disease.\\nThe Ayurvedic tradition oʃers much insight into what food will suit and balance each\\nindividual, how to prepare and cook this food properly, how to avoid food combinations\\nthat will create toxins in the body, and what eating habits to cultivate—and which to\\navoid—in order to receive the most nourishment from what you eat. All these topics,\\nexcept speciɹc guidelines on how to prepare and cook the food, will be discussed in this\\nchapter. (Interested readers may consult \\nAyurvedic Cooking for Self-Healing\\n by Usha Lad\\nand Dr. Vasant Lad, a complete reference guide to Ayurvedic cooking, including spices\\nand herbs, healing qualities of common foods, menu planning, and dozens of delicious\\nrecipes.)\\nFood Guidelines for the Constitutional Types\\nWhat you eat should be suited to your individual constitution. Ideally, in deciding\\nwhat to eat, you would know your constitution and understand its relationship to the\\nqualities of various kinds of food, including whether each food would be helpful or\\naggravating to your unique doshic balance. You would have to take into account the\\ntaste of the food (we will discuss that issue later in this chapter), and whether its\\nqualities \\nare heavy or light, oily or dry, liquid or solid. You would also have to know\\nwhether the food is cooling or heating (\\nvirya\\n), and its postdigestive effect (\\nvipaka\\n).\\nIf you are interested, you can go more deeply into Ayurvedic theory in order to fully\\ncomprehend these factors (see the \\nReading List\\n). Otherwise, the following charts take\\nthese factors into consideration in recommending what foods to eat or avoid.\\nThe charts categorize foods according to their suitability for each doshic type. Here\\nare a few points to remember:\\n• Foods marked “no” tend to aggravate that particular dosha, while foods marked\\n“yes” pacify or balance that dosha. In planning your diet, choose foods that create\\nbalance, and avoid those that might provoke your predominant doshas or the dosha that\\nis currently aggravated or increased.'),\n",

If a food is\\non your “no” list, that means you should avoid it most of the time, and if you eat it, eat\\na modest amount or do something to modify its eʃects. Apples, for example, are quite\\nvata-provoking if eaten raw. But if you cook them and eat them warm, with a little ghee\\nand warming spices such as cardamom or cinnamon, they are ɹne for vata individuals\\nin modest amounts.\\n• Keep the seasons in mind. Summer, for example, is pitta season, and it is not good\\n—especially for people with a predominantly pitta constitution—to eat too many hot,\\nspicy foods, or pitta dosha will become aggravated. Similarly, during autumn, when the\\nair is dry and cool and more vata is present in the atmosphere, everyone—but especially\\nindividuals with a vata constitution—should avoid dry fruit, salads, cold foods, and other\\nvata-provoking items. In winter and early spring, the heavy, cold, moist season of\\nkapha, one should make an extra eʃort to avoid cold food and drinks, ice cream, cheese,\\nyogurt, melons, and other kaphaincreasing foods.\\n• For individuals with a dual constitution (two doshas approximately equal), a little\\nextra care is needed, but you can ɹgure it out. For example, a vata-pitta individual\\nneeds to avoid vata-increasing foods in the fall and winter (but without increasing pitta\\ntoo much) and minimize pitta-provoking foods in the summer (but without aggravating\\nvata).

Foods\\nand herbs containing sweet, sour, and salty tastes are good for individuals of vata\\nconstitution.\\nHerbs and the Six Tastes\\nThe taste of an herb is not incidental but is directly related—indeed, directly\\nresponsible—for much of its therapeutic value. That is why Ayurvedic herbs are\\ngenerally taken in a form that requires tasting them, rather than concealing the\\ntaste in a capsule.\\nThere is no problem in taking an herb that has a sweet, pungent, or otherwise\\ntempting taste. But most people, particularly in Western culture, don’t like the\\nbitter or astringent tastes, and if they have to take an herb with either of these\\ntastes, they want to put the herb into a capsule and swallow it without tasting it.\\nSince the stomach has no taste buds, when the herb is taken this way, the eʃects\\nand beneɹts derived from the taste are lessened, because they are not perceived.\\nWhen we eat food, we don’t lose the eʃect of the tastes because we have to chew;\\nwhen we use capsules, we miss the taste of the herb.\\nOne of the reasons the Ayurvedic physician prescribes an herb is to balance\\nwhatever taste is lacking in the body. The herb transmits that taste and its eʃects\\ninto \\nrasa dhatu\\n (plasma). \\nTriphala\\n, for example, provides all the tastes except salty,\\nbut it tends to yield the predominant taste that is lacking in the body, which for'),\n",

That’s why for many people \\ntriphala\\n tastes bitter\\nfor some time. Later, after regular use, the bitter taste will have been received into\\nthe \\nrasa dhatu\\n, and \\ntriphala\\n may taste sour or sweet.\\nIn Ayurvedic medicine, most herbs are classiɹed according to their predominant\\ntaste, secondary aftertaste, and “potential” taste. The main taste acts on \\nrasa dhatu\\n,\\nthe aftertaste acts on the nervous system, and the third taste has either a heating or\\na cooling effect.\\nThis explains why it is important to have the eʃect of taste on the tongue when\\ntaking Ayurvedic medications.\\nPITTA\\n.

All their activities are self-centered and egotistical. They are kind,\\nfriendly, and faithful only to those who are helpful to them.\\nAll movement and activity is due to \\nrajas\\n, which leads to the life of sensual\\nenjoyment, pleasure and pain, eʃort and restlessness. People in whom \\nrajasic\\nqualities predominate tend to be egoistic, ambitious, aggressive, proud, and\\ncompetitive and have a tendency to control others. They like power, prestige, and\\nposition and are perfectionists. They are hard-working people but may be lacking\\nin proper planning and direction. Emotionally they tend to be angry, jealous, and\\nambitious and to have few moments of joy. They suʃer from a fear of failure, are\\nsubject to stress, and are quickly drained of mental energy. They require eight hours\\nof sleep.\\nTamas\\n is darkness, inertia, heaviness, and a tendency toward materialism.\\nIndividuals dominated by \\ntamas\\n are often less intelligent. They tend toward\\ndepression, laziness, and excess sleep, even during the day. A little mental work\\ntires them easily. They like jobs with less responsibility, and they love to eat, drink,\\nsleep, and have sex. They tend to be greedy, possessive, attached, irritable, and\\nuncaring toward others. They are willing to harm others for their own self-interest.\\nThere is a constant interplay of these three \\ngunas\\n in everyone’s consciousness,\\nbut the relative predominance of either \\nsattva, rajas\\n, or \\ntamas\\n is responsible for an\\nindividual’s psychological constitution.\\nIn the Ayurvedic literature, food is classiɹed as \\nsattvic, rajasic\\n, or \\ntamasic\\n according to\\nthe mental qualities it promotes. In brief, \\nsattvic\\n food is light, healthy food that increases\\nclarity of mind, \\nrajasic\\n food is tempting food that increases activity and agitation, and\\ntamasic\\n food is heavy, dulling food that creates depression and heaviness and leads to\\nmany disorders.\\nSattvic\\n food is light and easy to digest.

At the same time, Vedic philosophy teaches that there is a\\nconcurrent and inherent relationship between the macrocosm (the universe) and the\\nmicrocosm (the individual). The individual is constantly exposed to environmental\\nchanges, seasonal changes, changes in diet, lifestyle, emotions, job, ɹnancial status, and\\nrelationships. These changes are constantly bombarding every human being. To remain\\nhealthy or to regain health, all these factors have to be taken into consideration.\\nAs you have learned, when the body’s doshic balance of vata–pitta–kapha is\\ndisturbed, illness may result. The purpose of Ayurvedic healing is not just to relieve the\\nsymptoms of a specific illness but to bring the out-of-balance factors back into harmony.\\nThus, the purpose of Ayurvedic remedies, whether they be herbal medications,\\ndietary and nutritional changes, yoga postures, cleansing procedures, or breathing\\nexercises, is to eradicate the underlying causes of the disease, not merely to remove the\\nsymptoms. Of course one must deal directly with emergency or life-threatening\\nsymptoms, such as wheezing in asthma, heart pain in heart conditions, or high fever in\\ninfections. But if the fundamental causes of the illness are not dealt with, the problem\\nwill manifest again in the same or another form.\\nComponents of Ayurvedic Healing\\nThe Ayurvedic approach to restoring health is known as \\nchikitsa\\n (disease\\nmanagement) and traditionally consists of eight components. \\nIf you glance at the\\naccompanying box, you will note that \\nchikitsa\\n is a complete healing program that begins\\nwith identifying and eliminating the underlying cause of the illness, proceeds by\\npurifying the body and reestablishing balance, and ends with strengthening and\\nrevitalizing the affected organs, tissues, and systems so that the disease will not recur.\\nIf you become sick, your illness is not likely to become completely healed unless you\\nchange the behaviors that gave rise to it. Dietary indiscretions, a stressful lifestyle,\\nunresolved emotions, insuɽcient exercise—these are some of the factors that are at the\\nroot of most illness. Identifying and eliminating these causal factors are essential\\ncomponents of the healing process. If you take some of the recommended herbal\\nformulas but allow unhealthy lifestyle habits to continue unabated, it’s not likely that\\nyou will experience lasting or significant improvement.\\nThat is why, for each condition, I have suggested not only medications but numerous\\nother measures you can use for healing, such as speciɹc yoga postures and breathing\\nexercises, foods to favor or avoid, massage oils, teas, healing pastes, and many other\\nways to promote healing.

A\\nspecific treatment, for a specific type of condition, will be beneficial.\\nOn the other hand, if you do not take the time to diagnose carefully, the treatment\\nmay not be appropriate, and consequently you will not get the desired result. So before\\ndeciding on an Ayurvedic line of treatment, look carefully at the physical signs and\\nsymptoms that will help you determine whether it is a vata, pitta, or kapha illness or\\ncondition.

The pharmacopoeia of Ayurveda is vast, including literally\\nthousands of medicines, many of them herbal preparations. For each condition listed\\nhere, I have tried to include several very simple remedies, utilizing common kitchen\\nherbs or household strategies such as taking a warm bath. I also recommend some\\ncommon Ayurvedic herbs, most of which are easily obtained from various sources (see\\nResources\\n). For guidelines on how to prepare your own herbal formulas, how to take\\nherbs, how to make ghee, and other important information, please see \\nappendix 2\\n.\\nSEE WHAT WORKS\\n. For each condition, several suggestions are made. No one expects you to\\nuse all of them. Try what sounds good to you, and observe how it works. If it solves the\\nproblem, you don’t need to try any others. If it doesn’t seem to work, then try a different\\napproach. Each person is different and will react differently to these remedies.\\nDON’T BE DISCOURAGED IF A REMEDY DOESN’T WORK\\n. In self-treatment using Ayurvedic principles and\\nremedies, keep in mind a fundamental therapeutic guideline. If you diagnose your\\nproblem to be, for example, a vata disorder and embark on a treatment to reduce vata,\\nthen ɹnd that the treatment is not working or appears to be exacerbating the problem,\\nthis indicates that your diagnosis was not entirely correct.\\nThis does not mean you should give up on Ayurvedic remedies! Simply try using the\\ntreatment recommended for either pitta or kapha, whichever makes more sense to you\\nconsidering your symptoms. If you are untrained in Ayurvedic diagnosis, you may\\nsimply have made a mistake. So use your best judgment and try again.\\nSometimes the eʃect of the ɹrst remedy can give you a clue for a more beneɹcial\\ntreatment. For example, perhaps you thought your condition was due to excess kapha,\\nand you decided to use a heating herb \\nsuch as ginger, pepper, or \\ntrikatu\\n to treat it. If the\\ncondition worsens and you develop symptoms of aggravated pitta, such as irritability or\\na skin rash, you can infer that perhaps the problem was actually related to excess pitta.\\nReassess the situation, and take the next step.\\nBE SURE TO TREAT YOUR ACTUAL CONDITION\\n. Most imbalances and illnesses are related to\\nconstitution. As it is often said, “\\nPrakruti\\n indicates disease proneness.” Vata individuals\\nare likely to have vata-related problems, pitta individuals will have primarily pitta\\nconditions, and kaphas will have kapha illnesses.\\nHowever, in a small percentage of cases, your illness or condition may not coincide\\nwith your own constitutional type. For example, you may be predominantly a pitta\\ntype, but you may have a vata condition such as insomnia or constipation. It may be the\\nresult of any combination of vata-aggravating factors in your life, such as a vata diet, a\\ncold dry climate, or irregular hours. So when remedies are suggested, be careful to\\nchoose options that fit the symptoms of your \\ncondition\\n, not necessarily your body type.\\nHOW LONG TO TAKE A REMEDY\\n. In general, remedies should be used until your symptoms'),\n",

This may be a few days, a few weeks, or a few months, depending on several\\nimportant factors, such as: How severe is the disease or condition? How long have you\\nhad it? How motivated are you to get well?\\nFirst, assess your desire to get well. If you have a strong desire and are motivated to\\nget results, the ɹrst thing you need is diligence in following the prescribed Ayurvedic\\nregimen. Because of the law of \\nkarma\\n (cause and eʃect), to a great extent you will\\nderive benefits according to your own actions. So in addition to taking your herbs two or\\nthree times a day as recommended (no skipping, no forgetting them at home …), you\\nalso need to address the underlying causes of your condition by rethinking your diet,\\ndaily routine, exercise program, etc. Chances are that the herbal remedies alone, without\\nsome changes in your lifestyle, will not be powerful enough to override the very\\nbehavior patterns that caused the illness in the first place.\\nIf your condition is serious, and you are diligent with your remedies and make\\nappropriate lifestyle changes and still the symptoms persist, you need to see your doctor\\nfor help. On the other hand, if the condition is chronic, it is unrealistic to expect that\\nsomething that has persisted for years is going to disappear in a week or a month.\\nSo in deciding how long to use the recommended remedies, use your common sense.\\nAnd do your best right from the start: If you don’t, and you end up not getting the\\nresults you would like, it’s human nature that you will question whether you could have\\ndone better.\\nEvery disease process in the body, and every process of healing, has its own\\nmomentum, speed, and duration. You cannot make the mango ripen quickly; it ripens of\\nits own accord. So in order to eradicate the disease completely, allow suɽcient time,\\nand have patience. Ayurveda is not a quick ɹx. Anything that is quickly ɹxed does not\\nresolve the problem totally.\\nCautions\\nCONSULT YOUR DOCTOR\\n. Some of the conditions in this book are serious medical conditions\\nwhich require the supervision of a medical doctor. Mild or preclinical cases may\\nsometimes be completely healed using these Ayurvedic recommendations, but these\\nremedies are not a substitute for consulting with a physician.\\nIf you are already under a doctor’s care for a speciɹc illness or condition, the\\nAyurvedic remedies suggested here may be used in conjunction with the regimen\\noutlined by your physician. But it is only fair and proper to do so with his or her\\nknowledge and supervision.\\nAsk your doctor to carefully monitor your progress.

The vast majority of minor injuries and illnesses can be\\ntreated at home, with such natural means as lifestyle changes, diet, herbs, and simple\\nyoga stretching exercises. But sometimes it is absolutely crucial to get medical attention\\nfrom a qualiɹed physician or even from a trained hospital staʃ. This is extremely\\nimportant and must always be remembered.\\nFor example, diarrhea that lasts for a day or even a couple of days can be eʃectively\\ntreated at home (see “\\nDiarrhea\\n”). But suppose a person has profuse diarrhea that goes\\non for some time, so that he or she becomes severely dehydrated. This is a serious\\ncondition that requires hospitalization. It cannot be treated at home or even in the\\noutpatient department; it needs admission to a hospital so that intravenous feeding can\\nbegin immediately.\\nOr suppose someone has a high fever, perhaps 104 or 105 degrees Fahrenheit, and is\\nbabbling incoherently, appears delirious, and is losing consciousness. This is a serious\\nsituation and one has to act promptly to get help.\\nSo always be alert to the severity, intensity, persistence, or recurrence of any disease\\ncondition, and be sure to treat it properly. And remember: If you are not a trained\\nmedical professional, you may not always know. When in doubt, see a doctor.\\nA WORD ABOUT LICORICE TEA\\n. On several occasions I recommend the use of licorice tea.\\nIndividuals with hypertension (high blood pressure) may use this tea for emergencies\\n(such as to relieve an asthma attack—see “\\nAsthma\\n”), but they should not use it on a\\nregular basis; it promotes sodium retention, which may increase blood pressure.'),\n",

In the majority of cases (excluding tragic situations such as\\nbabies who are born addicted because of their mother’s addiction), people who are\\naddicted start out simply seeking more pleasure and joy in their life. Their life is diɽcult\\nand unhappy, their relationships may be painful and unfulɹlling, they may be\\ndissatisɹed and stressed at work, and they simply don’t know how to deal with the\\nsituation. So they escape from the reality of their circumstances into drugs or alcohol.\\nWhether the addictive substance is tobacco, marijuana, alcohol, or something else, it\\nsoon goes beyond being a psychological escape and becomes a chemical dependency.\\nThen, unless a certain level of the addictive substance is present in the blood, the\\nperson’s brain doesn’t function properly.\\nTreatment depends on how serious and long-standing the addiction is. For milder\\naddictions, such as a recent smoking habit, the person may simply be able to stop. But if\\na chronic alcoholic suddenly stops drinking, it creates alcohol withdrawal syndrome that\\nis difficult to deal with.\\nCLEANSING\\n. To eʃectively handle the problem of addiction, it is important to do\\npanchakarma\\n, an eʃective Ayurvedic cleansing and detox program. See \\nchapter 4\\n for a\\ndescription of \\npanchakarma\\n treatments you can receive at an Ayurvedic clinic, and a\\nhome \\npanchakarma\\n program you can do for yourself.\\nDOSE REDUCTION\\n. Along with this cleansing program, slowly decrease the dose of the\\naddictive substance. According to Ayurveda, unless some strong medications are\\navailable to deal with withdrawal, it is not good to completely stop using the addictive\\nsubstance all at once, or a stressful withdrawal syndrome will probably occur.\\n• With nicotine toxicity (which aʃects the lungs and cardiovascular system) and\\nalcohol toxicity (which aʃects the liver) we have to strengthen the aʃected organs.

A vata allergy may lead to sudden wheezing, sneezing,\\nheadache, ringing in the ears, or insomnia. For example, some individuals, when\\nexposed to dust or pollen, suddenly start wheezing. The wheezing is due to narrowing of\\nthe bronchial tree due to vata dosha. That person may also experience insomnia and\\nother vata-type symptoms.\\n• \\nIn a pitta type of allergy\\n, pitta dosha is already present under the skin. If the person\\ncomes in contact with an allergen, such as chemicals, ragweed, or certain synthetic\\nɹbers, then the pitta penetrates through the capillaries due to its hot and sharp qualities\\nand creates a rash, itching, hives, urticaria, allergic dermatitis, or eczema—all pitta-type\\nallergic reactions.\\n• \\nKapha allergies\\n are often experienced during spring season, when plants and trees\\nshed their pollens into the atmosphere. When the pollens, such as juniper or any other\\nɻower pollen, are inhaled, they enter the nasal-respiratory passage, and in some people\\nthey irritate the delicate mucous membrane, leading to hay fever, colds, congestion, a\\ncough, sinus infection, and even asthma.\\nIn order to treat allergies eʃectively, ɹrst we have to ɹnd out whether it is vata,\\npitta, or kapha type. Then we can determine the specific line of treatment.\\nIn most cases, perhaps 80 percent, your \\nprakruti\\n (constitution) predicts your allergy\\nproneness. That is, there is usually a correspondence between a person’s constitution\\nand the type of allergic reaction. A person of pitta \\nprakruti\\n is more likely to have a pitta\\nallergic reaction, especially when the \\nvikruti\\n or current status of the system shows a pitta\\nimbalance. But it may also happen that due to diet, environmental conditions,\\nemotional factors, or other causes, a kapha person may have a vata imbalance, and so\\nforth.\\nTREATMENT FOR VATA-TYPE ALLERGIES'),\n",

One of the most eʃective remedies for vata-type allergies is a \\ndashamoola\\n tea\\nbasti\\n (enema). Boil 1 tablespoon of the herbal compound \\ndashamoola\\n in 1 pint of water\\nfor 5 minutes to make a tea. Cool it, strain it, and use the liquid as an enema. (See\\nappendix 3\\n for complete directions.) Vata symptoms, such as wheezing, sneezing,\\ndryness of the throat, dryness of the colon leading to distension, constipation, and\\nabdominal discomfort, can be immediately corrected by this \\ndashamoola\\n tea \\nbasti\\n.\\nHERBAL REMEDIES\\n. Use this herbal formula:\\nashwagandha 1 part\\nbala 1 part\\nvidari 1 part\\nMix these herbs in equal proportion, and take ¼ teaspoon of the powder 3\\ntimes a day, washed down with warm water, to relieve vata allergies.\\n• To soothe an extreme wheezing condition, make one cup of either ginger or \\nlicorice\\ntea, boiling 1 teaspoon of the herb for about 3 minutes in 1 cup of water. Then add 5 to\\n10 drops of \\nmahanarayan\\n oil, mix thoroughly, and take 1 sip every 10 to 15 minutes. (If\\nyou do not have \\nmahanarayan\\n oil, you can substitute ½ teaspoon of plain ghee.)\\nTREATMENT FOR PITTA-TYPE ALLERGIES\\nHERBAL REMEDIES\\n.

Traditionally, Ayurveda has suggested that individuals with high\\npitta, who are prone to developing pitta-type problems such as sunburn in the summer\\nseason, do \\nrakta moksha\\n, or bloodletting, before the onset of the summer. Although this\\npractice is currently not very well respected in the West, it is still used widely in India,\\nas it has proven to be an eʃective preventive and healing measure. To make use of it\\ntoday, you might consider donating about ½ pint or 100 cc. of blood to a blood bank.\\nThat will help to defuse pitta conditions such as allergic dermatitis and allergic eczema.\\n• To produce a similar eʃect, you can use a blood-cleansing herbal combination.

Kapha allergies generally take the form of respiratory-pulmonary\\ncongestion, cough, cold, asthma, or hay fever. For relief from these conditions, use the\\nfollowing herbal formula:\\nsitopaladi 4 parts\\nyashti madhu 4 parts\\nabrak bhasma ⅛ part\\nTake about ¼ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with honey.\\nPURGATION THERAPY\\n. Kapha-type allergies occur when excess kapha collects in the stomach\\nand lungs. One way to relieve this congestion is purgation therapy (\\nvirechana\\n). \\nUse\\nɻaxseed oil (available in most natural food stores), and take 1 teaspoon 2 or 3 times a\\nday for 2 or 3 days. This will be quite effective. Or you can use \\ntriphala\\n (see below).\\nVOMITING THERAPY\\n. The Ayurvedic therapy that is particularly eʃective for removing\\nexcess kapha from the stomach and respiratory tract is \\nvamana\\n, or vomiting therapy. I\\nhave noticed, however, that people in the West have a strong cultural bias against\\nvomiting, and many seem particularly uncomfortable with this procedure. It not only\\nseems physically repugnant but may be emotionally diɽcult as well, as some emotional\\npuriɹcation may arise as a result of the physical puriɹcation. So if you tend to have\\nstrong emotions or have trouble dealing with them, it might be better for you not to try\\nvamana\\n.\\nIf you want to try it—and I want to emphasize that it is very effective for eliminating\\nexcess kapha—the procedure is to drink a stomach full of licorice tea and salt water and\\nthen to regurgitate it, emptying the stomach. Start by drinking several cups of licorice\\ntea, followed by a pint of water with about 1 teaspoon of salt mixed in. Drink enough to\\nfill your stomach, then rub the back of the tongue and vomit it out.\\nIMPORTANT CAUTION\\n: If you have high blood pressure, low blood pressure, hiatal\\nhernia, or a history of heart problems, do not do \\nvaman\\n therapy.'),\n",

For all three types of allergies, one can take ½ to 1 teaspoon of \\ntriphala\\n at\\nnight. (See \\nappendix 2\\n for instructions for preparing \\ntriphala\\n.) \\nTriphala\\n acts as both a\\nlaxative and a purgative. It consists of three herbs: \\namalaki, bibhitaki\\n, and \\nharitaki.\\nHaritaki\\n works on vata dosha, \\namalaki\\n on pitta dosha, and \\nbibhitaki\\n on kapha dosha.\\nDIETARY CHANGES\\n. For vata allergy, follow a vata-soothing diet; for pitta type of allergy,\\nthe pitta-pacifying diet; and for kapha allergy, the kapha-reducing diet. (Diet guidelines\\nmay be found in \\nchapter 8\\n.)\\nWATCH YOUR FOOD COMBINATIONS\\n. It is important for individuals with allergies not to eat\\nincompatible food combinations, such as milk and yogurt, meat and dairy, poultry and\\ndairy, melon and grains, or fruits and grains. Avoid such things as banana milk shakes\\nand “fruit smoothies” made with milk. For a more complete list of food incompatibilities,\\nplease turn to \\nthis page\\n.\\nAVOID THE CAUSE\\n. For most allergies, one should try to avoid the immediate cause: the\\nallergen. People who are allergic to cats, dogs, hair, pollen, mold, and so on should\\nsimply try to avoid them. Also try to stay away from synthetic ɹbers such as polyester\\nand rayon, which can cause pitta-type skin allergies. It is best to wear cotton clothing.\\nBecause of the large quantity of pesticides routinely sprayed on cotton, you might\\nconsider using only organic cotton \\nproducts, though they tend to be more expensive.\\nBLOCK THE ALLERGENS\\n. Generally, the respiratory passage is open to dust and other\\nallergens. One way to minimize the eʃect of allergens that you can’t avoid is to\\nlubricate the nasal mucous membrane with ghee. This prevents direct contact of the\\nallergen with the mucous membrane.\\nUSE NEEM OIL\\n. Another way to reduce or avoid the eʃect of environmental allergens is to\\napply \\nneem\\n oil to the exposed part of the body. The presence of the oil on the skin, as\\nwell as the disinfectant properties of \\nneem\\n, will minimize contact with the allergen.\\nNOTE\\n: Use \\nneem\\n herbalized oil—that is, \\nneem\\n leaves cooked in a base of sesame\\nor another oil. Pure \\nneem\\n extract will be too strong. If you ɹnd that even this\\nherbalized \\nneem\\n oil is too strong and creates an itching or burning sensation,\\nmix it half and half with coconut oil.\\nMEDITATE FOR STRESS REDUCTION\\n. Most allergies are stress related. Because of stress, imbalance\\nis created in mind and body. The practice known as Empty Bowl meditation helps to\\nrestore balance and thus helps take care of stress-related allergies. (See \\nchapter 7\\n for\\nguidelines.)\\nYOGA POSTURES\\n.

Also, \\nujjayi pranayama\\n helps to improve immunity\\nand is beneficial for all types of allergies.\\n \\nAnemia\\n \\nModern medicine has delineated several types of anemia: iron-deɹciency anemia,\\npernicious anemia, sickle-cell anemia, and hypoproteinemic anemia (lack of protein in\\nthe blood), as well as certain vitamin-deɹciency anemias, such as B-12 and folic acid-\\ndeɹciency anemia. Certain bleeding disorders, such as profuse menstrual bleeding,\\nbleeding hemorrhoids, or bleeding gums, can lead to anemia because of blood loss.\\nWhenever modern medicine deals with the problem of anemia, it considers all these\\netiological factors.\\nAyurveda looks at anemia quite diʃerently. Ayurvedic classiɹcation of anemia falls\\nunder three basic doshic conditions: vata type, pitta type, and kapha type. It doesn’t\\nmatter whether a person has iron deɹciency or folic acid deɹciency; what is important is\\nhow the anemia is expressing itself through a particular individual. As it turns out (see\\nbox \\nthis page\\n), there is also a correspondence between the Ayurvedic interpretation and\\nthe understanding according to modern medicine.\\nTYPES OF ANEMIA\\n• In vata-type anemia, the person looks thin, with dry, rough, scaly skin, and has\\ncracking of the joints. He or she looks emaciated and pale, may suʃer from\\nbreathlessness and constipation, and may pass tarry black stool.\\n• In pitta-type anemia, the eyes are slightly yellowish, the person may get high-\\ncolored urine, and the stools are dark brown or have a slightly yellowish tinge. There\\nmay be nausea or pain in the liver and/or spleen area. Dizziness or vertigo may be\\nexperienced, and the person may become easily irritated by light.\\n• In kapha-type anemia, there is often swelling (edema), and the person’s skin feels\\ncold and clammy and looks shiny. Because of the edema, the skin gets stretched so much\\nthat you can often see the reflection of the window on it.\\nBy careful observation one can tell whether the anemia is vata, pitta, or kapha type.\\nBy treating that dosha, one treats the root cause and can alleviate the anemia.\\nTREATMENT\\nFOR VATA-TYPE ANEMIA\\n. For vata anemia, Ayurveda suggests taking \\ntikta ghrita\\n, which is'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf', 'page': 125}, page_content='bitter ghee (see \\nappendix 2\\n). One teaspoon of \\ntikta ghrita\\n 5 to 10 minutes before\\nbreakfast, lunch, and dinner will help to improve the blood volume.\\n• One can also use a mixture of\\nkaishore guggulu 2 parts\\nabrak bhasma ⅛ part\\nashwagandha 5 parts\\ndashamoola 5 parts\\nTake ½ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with warm milk to help\\ncorrect vata-type anemia.\\n• A speciɹc formula is given in Vedic literature for a cleansing, detoxifying herbal\\nremedy for vata-type anemia. It is called \\ngandharva haritaki\\n, which is \\nharitaki\\n powder\\nroasted in castor oil in an iron pan. Place 1 tablespoon castor oil in an iron pan and\\nheat on the stove; when the oil is warm enough, sauté 1 ounce of the herb \\nharitaki\\n. The\\nharitaki\\n will become thick and will turn slightly brown. (You have to stir it.) Take ½\\nteaspoon of \\ngandharva haritaki\\n at bedtime, washed down with warm water. Take it for 2\\nmonths or until the blood returns to normal.\\nNOTE\\n: This mixture may cause loose stools; if this happens, reduce your dosage\\nuntil comfortable.\\nFOR PITTA-TYPE ANEMIA\\n. For pitta anemia, Ayurveda suggests \\nshatavari\\n ghee. (The \\nshatavari\\nand the ghee are cooked together. Directions for preparing herbalized and medicated\\nghees and oils appear in \\nappendix 2\\n.) Take 1 teaspoon of \\nshatavari\\n ghee 3 times a day,\\nbefore breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\\n• One can also use this herbal formula:\\nshatavari 5 parts\\nbrahmi 3 parts\\nneem 2 parts\\nloha bhasma ⅛ part\\nMix these herbs, and take ½ teaspoon of the mixture 3 times a day with 2\\ntablespoons of aloe vera gel. This combination \\nwill be quite eʃective in treating\\npitta-type anemia.\\nFOR KAPHA-TYPE ANEMIA\\n. Where there is swelling, use:\\npunarnava 5 parts\\ngokshura 3 parts\\nkutki 2 parts'),\n",

Or you can mix it with a little honey and then wash it down with water.\\nFOR ALL TYPES OF ANEMIA\\nEAT IRON-RICH FOODS\\n. Iron is a good blood builder, so foods rich in iron, such as beets,\\ncarrots, grapes, raisins, and currants, are used in the Ayurvedic treatment of most\\nanemias. Figs, dates, and date sugar are also good sources of iron. Pomegranate juice\\nand cranberry juice can be used as blood builders, as can a combination of beet and\\ncarrot juice. (Add a pinch of cumin to your carrot/beet juice for maximum eʃect.)\\nChlorophyll is also a good source of iron, and many times Ayurveda does suggest using\\nchlorophyll, generally in the form of spinach, chard, and other fresh green vegetables.\\nYOGURT AND TURMERIC\\n. Eat a cup of plain yogurt with up to 1 teaspoon turmeric on an\\nempty stomach, morning and afternoon. Do not eat this after sunset. If kapha is\\nunbalanced, eat this at noon only.\\nBLUE-GREEN ALGAE\\n. Blue-green algae can also be eʃectively used, but primarily for pitta\\nanemia. Because it is a rich source of \\nprana\\n, it is not good for vata individuals, as it will\\nmake them quite hyper. Kapha types may also find it beneficial.\\nCOPPER WATER\\n. Vata and kapha individuals may ɹnd copper water eʃective. Fill a\\ngenuine copper glass or cup with water and let it stand overnight, then drink it in the\\nmorning (see \\nappendix 1\\n).\\nDIET AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES\\n. These choices should follow the general guidelines (diet,\\nexercise, and so on) for each doshic \\nconstitutional type. For vata problems, follow the\\nanti-vata guidelines; for pitta anemia follow the pitta-soothing diet and other guidelines;\\nand for kapha-type anemia, follow the kapha-reducing guidelines.\\nCorrelation of Ayurvedic and Western Types of Anemia\\nClinical observation has shown that the various types of anemia classiɹed by\\nmodern medicine can be correlated with the types of anemia delineated by\\nAyurveda. For example, pitta-type anemia has been associated with mononucleosis\\nand hepatitis and may lead to problems with the liver. Cobalamine (vitamin B-12)-\\ndeɹciency anemia is also associated with pitta. Kapha-type anemia may lead to\\nhypo-proteinemic anemia and swelling, while vata-type anemia may be associated\\nwith iron deɹciency and folic acid–deɹciency anemia. By treating the vata–pitta–\\nkapha types of anemia, Ayurveda can at the same time treat the types of anemia\\ncategorized by modern medicine.\\nYOGA \\nASANAS\\n.\\n Yoga postures good for anemia of both the vata and kapha varieties'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf', 'page': 127}, page_content='include the Locust pose, Lotus pose, and inverted poses (Shoulder Stand, Plow pose,\\nHeadstand), which bring the blood supply to the vital organs such as the thyroid,\\nthymus, and brain. Headstand will not be good for pitta-type anemia, but the Sun\\nSalutation, as well as the Boat, Bow, and Bridge poses, will be effective.\\nBREATHING EXERCISE\\n. For all anemic conditions, \\nsurya pranayama\\n (Right Nostril breathing)\\nis recommended. Block your left nostril with your right ring ɹnger and breathe only\\nthrough the right nostril. Right Nostril breathing stimulates the liver, which plays an\\nimportant role in building the blood.\\n \\nAnger and Hostility\\n \\nAnger and hostility are signs of aggravated pitta in the nervous system. Pitta is\\nnecessary for right understanding and judgment, but when it gets disturbed or out of\\nbalance, it creates misunderstanding and wrong judgment, leading to anger and\\nhostility. The aim is to bring the pitta back to its normal constitutional function.\\nHere are several simple home remedies to cool down that hot pitta and keep tempers\\nunder control.\\nDIET\\n. Perhaps most important, a person who becomes angry easily or often should\\nfollow the pitta-pacifying diet (see \\nchapter 8\\n), especially avoiding hot, spicy and\\nfermented foods, citrus fruit, and sour fruit. Favor simple, bland foods and cool drinks,\\nand avoid alcohol and drinks with caffeine.\\nKEEP COOL\\n. It’s also not recommended for people with a pitta body type to take saunas\\nor steam baths, to get overheated from exercise or sports, or to be in too much direct\\nsun. In other words: keep cool.\\nOIL MASSAGE\\n. Rub some \\nbhringaraj\\n oil or coconut oil on your scalp and on the soles of the\\nfeet. That will help to bring down the excess pitta. (See instructions for preparing\\nherbalized ghees and oils in \\nappendix 2\\n.) You can do this every night before getting in\\nbed to regularly moderate pitta. Be sure to wear some old socks and a hat, or put a\\ntowel on your pillow, to prevent the oil from staining.\\nUSE SANDALWOOD OIL\\n. Another simple and eʃective way to help balance your emotions is\\nto place a drop of sandalwood essential oil on the “third eye” area between your\\neyebrows, as well as on the throat, breastbone, navel, temples, and wrists. Just a small\\namount of oil is sufficient.\\nHERBAL TEAS\\n. Drink chamomile-tulsi-rose tea.\\nchamomile 1 part\\ntulsi (holy basil) 1 part\\nrose petal powder 2 parts'),\n",

Allow this tea to cool before you drink it.\\nHAVE A PITTA-PACIFYING DRINK\\n. Into 1 cup of grape juice, add ½ teaspoon cumin, ½ teaspoon\\nfennel, and ½ teaspoon sandalwood powder. This cooling, pitta-pacifying drink will\\nhelp to settle angry feelings and other pitta symptoms such as burning in the stomach.\\nGHEE \\nNASYA\\n.\\n Dip your little ɹnger into a jar of \\nbrahmi\\n ghee (or plain ghee if you haven’t\\nmade \\nbrahmi\\n ghee), and lubricate the inside of your nostrils with a small amount.

(See \\nappendix 4\\n for illustrations of yoga postures.) Avoid the\\nHeadstand or other inverted poses such as the Plow and Shoulder Stand. Do not perform\\nthe Sun Salutation; do the Moon Salutation instead.\\nMEDITATE\\n. There is an ancient method of meditation that involves watching your every\\nemotion come and go, without either naming it or trying to tame it. As the feelings\\narise, breathe deeply, and exhale the emotions out.\\n \\nAngina\\n \\nAngina, or to give it its full name, angina pectoris (chest pain), is a condition created\\nby kapha dosha. Accumulated kapha blocks the ɻow of \\nprana\\n vata into the coronary\\nartery, so that the heart muscles do not receive suɽcient blood and oxygen supply. It is\\na kind of local anemia, resulting in pain that can be severe and frightening. Typically,\\nthe pain starts from the breastbone in the center of the chest, goes to the left shoulder,\\nand passes along the inner side of the upper arm to the tip of the little finger.\\nHERBAL REMEDIES\\n.

You may ɹnd this\\nremedy beneficial for both chest pain and heart palpitations.\\nSPECIAL HERBS\\n. In India, angina is often directly dealt with by taking certain powerful\\nherbs sublingually (under the tongue) to produce immediate relief, as nitroglycerin\\ntablets are often used in modern medicine. Ask your Ayurvedic physician about these\\nherbs.\\nA HEALING PASTE\\n. Topically, one can apply a paste to the chest.

So if you\\nhave any chest pain that could be due to your heart, please consult your doctor.\\nEspecially—but not exclusively—if you get chest pain from less exertion than\\nusual, or if your chest pain lasts longer than a few minutes, treat it as a medical\\nemergency.\\nGOLD WATER\\n. Taking 1 teaspoon of gold water 2 or 3 times a day before food is also\\neffective. (See \\nappendix 1\\n for instructions on making gold water.)\\nYOGA POSTURES\\n. If there is no acute angina pain, you can improve coronary circulation by\\ndoing some gentle yoga stretching.

But if severe\\nanxiety continues for a long time or becomes overwhelming and interferes with\\nyour social or occupational functioning, medical attention is required. Here are\\nthree reasons to see a doctor:\\n1\\n. \\nYou chronically experience severe symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest\\npressure or pain, and dizziness, along with extreme worry and tension.\\n2\\n. \\nYou have panic attacks—short, unexplained periods of intense fear.\\n3\\n. \\nYou avoid people, places, or situations in order to avoid feeling anxious.\\nThis formula eʃectively paciɹes vata and reduces anxiety. You can drink this\\ntea twice a day.\\nRELAXING BATH\\n. A warm bath of ginger and baking soda will help you pacify anxiety. Use\\n⅓ cup ginger and ⅓ cup baking soda in a tubful of water. Soak for 10 to 15 minutes.\\nALMOND MILK\\n. Almond milk helps to eliminate anxiety. Soak about 10 raw (not toasted)\\nalmonds overnight in water. Peel oʃ the skins, and put the almonds in the blender. Add\\n1 cup warm milk. While blending, add a pinch of ginger and a small pinch of nutmeg\\nand saffron.\\nORANGE JUICE\\n.

Make a ɹst with your left hand, so that the ɹngers rest in the\\nmiddle of the palm. Locate the point where the middle ɹnger ends, in the “heart” of the\\npalm. Then, with the thumb of your right hand, press ɹrmly on this point in the center\\nof your left hand. Press for 1 minute. This \\nwill calm down the agitation of \\nprana\\n, which\\ncauses anxiety.\\nAyurvedic Oil Massage\\nGiving yourself a full-body oil massage will greatly help to reduce anxiety. Vatas\\nshould use sesame oil; pittas, sunɻower or coconut oil; kaphas, corn oil. Use 6 or 7\\nounces of warmed-up (\\nnot hot\\n) oil, and rub it over your whole body from head to\\ntoes.

Low agni may be due to\\nslow metabolism, or slow metabolism caused by low agni; each aʃects the other. Low\\nagni creates not only poor appetite but also indigestion, bloating, ama (toxins) in the\\ngastrointestinal tract, coating on the tongue, and bad breath. Lack of energy is also\\ncommon.\\nThe most eʃective treatment for this situation may surprise you: Don’t eat. A short\\nfast will help to kindle the digestive ɹre. Skip breakfast, and don’t nibble anything. By\\nnoon your appetite will probably return, and you will be hungry and ready to eat.\\nLack of appetite is often due to continual munching, combined with drinking cold\\ndrinks, which depress agni. For the sake of good digestion and long-term health, as well\\nas reviving your appetite, both of these bad habits have to be stopped.\\nIf you are not hungry even by lunchtime, take some fresh ginger, chop a little into\\nsmall pieces, add some lime juice and a pinch of rock salt, and chew it up. That will\\nkindle agni and stimulate the appetite.\\nLow appetite may also be due to emotional factors. If that is the case, make a tea of\\nginger, \\nbrahmi\\n, and chamomile in equal proportions. Use 1 teaspoon of this mixture per\\ncup of water, steep for 5 to 10 minutes, and drink.\\nAlso, take ½ teaspoon of \\ntriphala\\n in a cup of warm water every night before going to\\nbed. Pour boiling water into the \\ntriphala\\n, and let it cool until it’s comfortable to drink.\\nThese few simple measures should be enough to help you regain a healthy appetite.\\nIf you try them and still don’t feel like eating, see your doctor, as lack of appetite can be\\na symptom of a more serious illness.\\n \\nArthritis\\n \\nAyurveda distinguishes three categories of arthritis, corresponding to vata, pitta, and\\nkapha.

They become dry and are not\\nswollen as they may be if excess vata is not the cause. The joints may also feel cold to\\nthe touch. They are painful mostly upon movement, and there is usually one particular\\ntender spot. Jogging, jumping, trampolining, or any strenuous exercise tends to\\naggravate the pain.\\n• \\nPitta-type arthritis\\n is characterized by inɻammation; the joint becomes swollen and \\nis\\npainful even without movement. It often looks red and feels hot to the touch.\\n• \\nIn kapha-type arthritis\\n, the joint also becomes stiʃ and swollen, but it feels cold and\\nclammy rather than hot. A little movement, rather than aggravating the pain, tends to\\nrelieve it. The pain is greater in the morning, and as the person starts moving around,\\nthe pain diminishes.\\nFOR ALL TYPES OF ARTHRITIS\\nTreatment for each type of arthritis is unique, as we shall see in a moment. But for\\nall cases, it is important to know that arthritis begins in the colon.\\nDepending on the person’s lifestyle, diet, and emotional pattern, either vata, pitta,\\nor kapha goes out of balance. Then that particular dosha slows down agni (digestive\\nfire), resulting in the toxic, sticky by-product of inadequate digestion known as ama.\\nVata, the main active dosha, brings the ama into the colon, and from there it travels\\nthrough the system and lodges in the \\nasthi dhatu\\n (bone tissue) and in the joints, giving\\nrise to the stiffness and pain characteristic of arthritis.\\nSo our aim in treating arthritis is to remove the ama from the joint and bring it back\\nto the colon, and then to eliminate it.\\nThis is why, to relieve arthritis, it is important to keep the colon clean. To accomplish\\nthis, if you do not know positively whether it is vata, pitta, or kapha arthritis, taking\\ntriphala\\n at night (1 teaspoon) with some warm water (½ to 1 cup) will be effective for all\\ntypes. Alternatively, if you know positively which type it is, you can use \\nharitaki\\n for\\nvata-type arthritis, \\namalaki\\n for pitta-type, and \\nbibhitaki\\n for kapha-type arthritis (½ to 1\\nteaspoon with warm water in all cases).\\nNow for the complete treatments.\\nFOR VATA-TYPE ARTHRITIS\\n• Follow the vata-pacifying diet (\\nchapter 8\\n). Favor warm, easy-to-digest foods, and\\navoid cold foods and drinks, including salads. Avoid beans, drying grains such as barley\\nand corn, and the nightshades: tomato, potato, and eggplant.'),\n",

Whatever the cause\\nof your backache, the following natural Ayurvedic home remedies will be helpful.\\nHERBAL REMEDIES\\n. Take \\nyogaraj guggulu\\n, 1 tablet 3 times a day, or 1 tablet of \\nkaishore\\nguggulu\\n 2 or 3 times a day. Both of these special Ayurvedic formulas are available from\\nmost sources of Ayurvedic herbs (see \\nResources\\n).\\n• Backache can also be relieved by the use of the herb \\nmusta\\n, which is a muscle\\npainkiller.

Taking ½ teaspoon of either\\nwith some warm water will relax the muscles that may be causing back pain. It will also\\nhelp induce restful sleep.\\nMost back pain can be eʃectively treated with these herbs, but a ruptured or slipped\\ndisk often requires intensive medical care.\\nRUB IN SOME OIL\\n. Rubbing the painful area of the back with \\nmahanarayan\\n oil is also\\neʃective for relieving the pain. Vata and pitta types should just rub the oil on the\\nsurface, while kapha types should give a deeper massage to the area for some time.\\nAlternatively, try this procedure: Apply a paste made of ginger powder mixed with\\nsuɽcient water to the aʃected area. Leave it on for 10 to 15 minutes, wash it oʃ, and\\nthen rub the back with some eucalyptus oil.\\n(Unless your back pain is in the neck or shoulder area, these back rubs will have to\\nbe done by a friend!)\\nTAKE A HOT HERBALIZED BATH\\n.

It can also be due to chronic indigestion or malabsorption. When digestion is\\nweak or sluggish, the food you eat undergoes fermentation and putrefaction in the\\ngastrointestinal tract, leading to the formation of ama, which has a foul smell.\\nStand in front of a mirror, and stick out your tongue. If the back portion of the\\ntongue is coated, that is the sign of ama, which is responsible for the bad breath.\\nThe primary Ayurvedic aim in treating bad breath is to kindle gastric ɹre (agni),\\nwhich in turn burns ama and alleviates the root cause of the condition. Here are several\\neffective home remedies to prevent and treat bad breath.\\nDIETARY AND HERBAL REMEDIES\\n• First monitor your diet. It’s important not to eat heavy meals, and to stay away\\nfrom cold drinks, ice cream, cheese, and yogurt, all of which reduce the gastric ɹre \\nand\\nslow down digestion, with a likely increase of ama.\\n• Then, after each meal (generally after lunch and dinner), chew about 1 teaspoon of\\nroasted fennel and cumin seeds (mixed half and half). This will improve digestion, which\\nindirectly helps to detoxify the colon. The licorice-ɻavored fennel seeds alone would be\\ndelicious and helpful, but this mixture will have a better effect.\\n• Drink ½ cup of aloe vera juice twice a day until freshness is restored to the breath.\\n• Slowly chewing one or two cardamom seeds also helps to minimize bad breath.\\nCardamom aids digestion and helps to reduce ama.\\n• After each meal, drink a cup of cumin-coriander-fennel tea (equal proportions) as a\\ndigestive aid. Steep about ¼ to ½ teaspoon of each herb per cup of hot water.\\nOTHER REMEDIES\\nTAKE CARE OF YOUR TEETH AND GUMS\\n. Another cause of bad breath is poor oral hygiene. It’s\\nimportant to clean the teeth after each meal. Use an Ayurvedic toothpaste containing\\nneem\\n or an herbal formula. Also use dental ɻoss every day. Applying some tea tree oil\\nmixed half and half with \\nneem\\n oil to the gums and gently massaging will help prevent\\nreceding gums. Be sure to spit out the residue rather than swallowing.

It may be related to disease—I have seen hair\\nloss in persons with diabetes, for example, or following typhoid infection. It may be due\\nto some fungal infection on the scalp, or to hormonal imbalance. A deɹciency of\\ncalcium, magnesium, and zinc may aʃect the nourishment of the hair enough that the\\nhair starts to fall out. And there is a deɹnite hereditary factor, in which genes appear to\\ntrigger hair loss at a certain age.\\nAccording to Ayurveda, early hair loss is often related to body type and the balance\\nof the doshas. Pitta individuals, and those who have excess pitta in their system, are\\nmore likely than the other body types to lose their hair early in life, or to ɹnd that their\\nhair becomes prematurely thin or gray. Excess pitta in the sebaceous gland, at the root\\nof the hair, or folliculitis (inɻammation of the hair follicles) can make the person start\\nlosing hair.\\nALOE VERA\\n. To reduce pitta and preserve the health of your hair, drink aloe vera juice\\n(⅓ cup) or take some aloe vera gel (1 tablespoon with a pinch of cumin) 3 times a day\\nfor about 3 months.\\nOIL MASSAGE\\n. Another eʃective way to pacify pitta is to rub some coconut oil on \\nyour\\nscalp and on the soles of your feet at bedtime. Wear some old socks, and to preserve the\\nhealth of your pillow, wear a loose woolen cap or cover the pillow with a towel so it\\nwon’t get damaged by the oil.\\n• Massaging the scalp with \\nbrahmi\\n oil or \\nbhringaraj\\n oil at bedtime can help to prevent\\nhair loss. In addition to the qualities of the oil, the massage itself will improve\\ncirculation at the root of the hair, thus bringing more nutrients to support hair growth.\\n• Massaging the hair with vitamin E oil may also be eʃective in preventing or\\nslowing hair loss.\\nFOOD FOR YOUR HAIR\\n.

So stings\\nand bites, though usually quite innocuous, may occasionally be very serious; one has to\\nbe watchful.\\nCILANTRO\\n. As soon as possible after receiving a sting or bite, take some cilantro juice.\\nPlace a handful of cilantro in a blender with about ⅓ cup water, blend thoroughly, and\\nstrain it.

At the site of the bite, you can also apply \\nneem\\n oil or a \\nneem\\npaste. \\nNeem\\n is an antidote to most poisonous insect venoms. To make a paste, take a\\nlittle \\nneem\\n powder and mix it with a little water. Apply it to the skin and leave it on for\\n10 to 20 minutes, then rinse it oʃ. Do not use pure \\nneem\\n extract; instead use an\\nherbalized oil made by boiling \\nneem\\n leaves in a sesame oil base.

There may be pain in the bladder area while\\nurinating, a condition called strangury. Let’s look at each of these.\\nRETENTION OF URINE IN THE BLADDER\\nIn this condition the bladder is distended but the person doesn’t pass urine. It may be\\ndue to constriction of the urethra, enlargement of the prostate gland, or perhaps a stone\\nin the urethra. The causes may be many, but the cure is simple:\\n• Take two towels or sponges, one dipped in hot water, the other dipped in cool\\nwater. About every minute, alternate placing them in the bladder area. This alternation\\nof hot and cold stimulates the bladder, and the person easily passes urine.\\n• If alternating hot and cold compresses isn’t completely successful, apply \\npunarnava\\npaste (\\npunarnava\\n powder with suɽcient water to make a paste) to the skin directly\\nabove the distended bladder. Leave it on for about half an hour.\\n• If the retention is due to stricture (narrowing) in the urethra or enlargement of the\\nprostate gland, then use this formula:\\npunarnava guggulu 4 parts\\nshilajit 1 part\\nTaking ½ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with warm water will help\\nto dilate the stricture or relax the prostate gland and help to restore the easy\\nflow of the urine.\\nCYSTITIS\\nCystitis causes a burning sensation while urinating. To relieve this condition, drink\\ncoriander tea, cumin tea, or fennel tea. Or make a tea of equal proportions of these\\nthree herbs. Cumin-coriander-fennel tea is widely used in Ayurveda to relieve irritation\\nof the bladder while passing urine.\\nYou may also find this mixture effective for cystitis:\\npunarnava 5 parts\\ngokshura 4 parts'),\n",

It is more common among women. A woman may sneeze or cough\\nand inadvertently passes some urine. For this condition, take one handful of white\\nsesame seeds along with 1 teaspoon of jaggery or natural, unreɹned brown sugar, and\\nchew it well, followed by half a cup of water to wash it down. This is a very simple\\nremedy to bring tone back to the bladder. Take it once or twice a day until your\\ncondition is better.\\nFor further discussion and suggestions, see “\\nUrinary Incontinence\\n” and “\\nProstate\\nProblems\\n.”\\n \\nBleeding, External\\n \\nGenerally, within 5 to 6 minutes after getting a cut, the bleeding will stop by itself.\\nThe blood will clot, the bleeding will stop, and the cut will be sealed. In such cases—the\\nvast majority—there is nothing much to do unless the cut is severe and bleeding is\\nexcessive.\\nSome people, however, bleed for a longer time, because the blood does not cooperate\\nand clot quickly enough. When a person continues to bleed, it basically means that the\\nblood is too thin. Although the problem usually has a relatively simple and benign cause,\\nfailure of the blood to clot—or gums, cuts, or wounds that start to bleed—may also be an\\nearly sign of blood cancer, leukemia, or hemophilia purpura, a pitta disorder that causes\\nprofuse bleeding under the skin.\\nFrom the Ayurvedic perspective, blood that fails to clot in a timely manner is due to\\na pitta imbalance. Excess pitta in the blood makes the blood hot, sharp, and penetrating\\nand doesn’t allow natural coagulation and clotting to occur. The basic prescription,\\nthen, is to follow a pitta-soothing diet, use pitta-soothing herbs, and take speciɹcally\\nhemostatic herbs, herbs that directly help to stop bleeding.\\nAPPLY COLD\\n. To stop external bleeding, start by applying cold. Use some ice (plain or\\nwrapped in a cloth), which helps to constrict the blood vessels and stop bleeding. A bag\\nof frozen vegetables from the freezer will do the job in an emergency.\\nAPPLY PRESSURE\\n. Other simple ways to stop bleeding, well known to most people, are\\n1\\n. \\ntying a tourniquet'),\n",

Another eʃective approach is to apply some aloe. A pinch of aloe powder mixed\\ninto a paste with a pinch of turmeric powder will immediately stop most bleeding. Aloe\\nvera gel will also be effective.\\nASTRINGENT HERBS\\n. Other astringent herbs are also eʃective. The Ayurvedic herbs \\nlodhra,\\nkushtha\\n, and \\nbilva\\n are eʃective to stop bleeding, either alone or mixed in equal\\nproportions into a paste that can be applied directly. They are also eʃective taken\\ninternally for continuing problems with bleeding, use ½ teaspoon 2 or 3 times a day.\\nCOTTON ASH\\n. For external bleeding, you will ɹnd this ancient, simple remedy eʃective.\\nTake a small ball of sterilized cotton, and burn it. (Be sure it is real cotton, not the\\nsynthetic material often found these days, which will be totally ineʃective.) When the\\ncotton turns to black ash, wait for it to cool down, and then apply it to the bleeding\\nwound and press. The ash will stick to the bleeding point and stop the bleeding\\ninstantaneously. Within a couple of days a scab will form, and the wound will\\ncompletely heal.\\nNOTE\\n: Don’t remove the ash; leave it on the wound to form a scab. Otherwise\\nyou will open the cut again.\\nDRINK COLD WATER\\n. Many times just drinking some cold water will stop the bleeding, as\\ncoolness constricts blood vessels.\\n \\nBleeding, Internal\\n \\nSee also “\\nRectal Bleeding\\n”\\nCases of internal bleeding include peptic ulcer, hematoma (a blood-ɹlled swelling),\\nand bleeding through the urethra. To help put a stop to the bleeding, make an herbal\\ncompound out of these Ayurvedic herbs:\\nlodhra\\nkushtha\\nbilva\\nMix these herbs in equal amounts, and take ½ teaspoon 2 or 3 times a day.\\nEach of these herbs helps to stop bleeding, so you can use just one if that’s all\\nyou can locate, though the mixture will be most effective.\\nPitta people bruise more easily; their blood vessels are thin and are more easily'),\n",

When a person has been injured, the blood vessels sometimes rupture,\\ncausing a large bruise and a blood-ɹlled swelling known as a hematoma. To stop the\\ninternal bleeding and pacify the hematomalike swelling, apply a paste made of 1\\nteaspoon turmeric powder, 1 teaspoon sandalwood powder, and a pinch of alum\\npowder. (Mix the powders together with a little water to make a paste.) When the paste\\nis on the skin, apply some pressure on the hematoma.\\nSAFFRON MILK\\n. Another aid to stopping internal bleeding is to drink a cup of warm milk,\\nto which ½ teaspoon of turmeric powder and a pinch of saffron have been added.\\nJUICES\\n. Drinking cranberry or pomegranate juice is also helpful to stop internal\\nbleeding.\\n \\nBoils\\n \\nBoils—painful, pus-ɹlled inɻammations of the skin and subcutaneous tissue—have\\nmany causes. They may be due to chronic constipation, or to high pitta in the blood. A\\ntoxic liver can also create boils. Repeated boils may be a sign of diabetes, so if you get\\nboils repeatedly, check on your blood sugar.\\nNEEM POWDER PASTE\\n. At the site of the boil, apply a paste of \\nneem\\n powder (preferably) or\\nsome \\nneem\\n oil. To make the paste, simply mix a little \\nneem\\n powder with warm water.\\nTRIPHALA WASH\\n.

It is also the time\\nwhen many kapha disorders occur (such as colds and runny noses) and when kapha may\\nstagnate in the stomach, slowing down the appetite. Giving this fennel tea will help to\\nwash out the kapha and in a gentle way stimulate the secretion of digestive enzymes.\\nMAKE GHRITA MADHU\\n. Mix a pinch of \\npippali\\n in ½ teaspoon of honey combined with ½\\nteaspoon ghee. Give it to your baby to lick. The more he or she licks the mixture, the\\nmore the appetite will come back.\\nMONITOR YOUR DIET\\n. One possible reason for a baby’s apparent lack of appetite is that\\nyour milk may not taste good to the child. If you tend to have excess pitta in your\\nconstitution, and especially if your diet is hot and spicy or includes sour foods and fruits,\\nyour milk may become bitter, and the baby won’t like it. This unpleasant taste could be\\nthe cause of the child’s apparent lack of appetite. So it is important to determine the\\nmother’s \\nprakruti\\n (constitutional type) and to be sure the diet she is eating is\\nappropriate.\\nEMPTY YOUR BREASTS\\n. If your child has a diminished appetite and you are secreting more\\nmilk than gets used, it is important to empty your breasts. This will avoid congestion of\\nthe mastic and lymphatic tissue. Be sure the breasts are emptied of milk at least 2 or 3\\ntimes a day.\\nIF YOU DECIDE NOT TO BREASTFEED\\n. A related situation occurs when a woman chooses not to\\nbreastfeed her child. Then the milk is stagnant, which may be one of the causes of\\nɹbrocystic changes in the breast. So it is important to empty the breasts whenever milk\\nis present.\\nTHERE IS INSUFFICIENT MILK\\nThe child has a strong appetite, but lactation is scanty. This problem is the reverse of\\nthe first. Here are several suggestions to increase the quality and quantity of milk.\\nSHATAVARI KALPA\\n. To increase lactation, Ayurveda recommends a delicious concoction\\ncalled \\nshatavari kalpa\\n: the herb \\nshatavari\\n roasted in a pan with ghee and natural brown\\nsugar. Take one teaspoon of that sweet, roasted \\nshatavari\\n in warm milk 2 or 3 times a\\nday.\\nPLAIN SHATAVARI\\n. You can also use plain \\nshatavari\\n with ghee and sugar. Mix together equal\\namounts of \\nshatavari\\n and natural sugar, and take 1 teaspoon of the mixture with 1\\nteaspoon of ghee along with a cup of hot milk.\\nALMOND MILK\\n. Another formula to increase breast milk is almond milk. Soak 10 almonds\\novernight in water. In the morning, peel them and blend them in the blender with a cup\\nof hot water or hot milk. Pour the mixture into a cup or glass, and add 1 teaspoon \\nhoney\\nor date sugar, and a pinch each of ginger, cardamom, and saffron. Drink twice a day.'),\n",

So take care to wash carefully to\\nprevent this from happening.\\nPREVENTION\\nTo prevent breast abscess, mastitis, congestion, and stagnation of milk in the breast,\\ngently massage your breasts with warm castor oil. Take 1 teaspoon of the oil, and gently\\nmassage the breast from inside outward—that is, from the sternum (breastbone) back\\ntoward the armpit, both underneath and around the nipple, and to the side.\\nDo not apply the castor oil to the areola and nipple. If you apply castor oil to the\\nnipple and your baby sucks the oil, he or she may get diarrhea. So either avoid the\\nnipple or wash off the oil before nursing the child.\\n \\nBreasts, Sore\\n \\nSore breasts are generally symptomatic of hormonal imbalance, lymphatic\\ncongestion, or premenstrual syndrome. Or the physical discomfort may be associated\\nwith some emotional factor, such as grief or sadness. Here are several suggestions for\\neffective self-treatment:\\nGENTLE MASSAGE\\n. Take 1 teaspoon of warm castor oil, and gently massage the breast from\\ninside outward, that is, from the sternum (breastbone) back toward the armpit, both\\nunderneath and around the nipple, and to the side. This kind of gentle massage before\\nthe morning bath, as well as at bedtime, will help to relieve the soreness.\\nHERBS FOR WATER RETENTION\\n.

If you have these symptoms, you\\ncan be sure they are signs of malnutrition of the bone tissue.\\nTo strengthen the bones and nails, take over-the-counter supplements of calcium,\\nmagnesium, and zinc.

If you are taking calcium, magnesium, and zinc as a dietary\\nsupplement and your nails are still brittle, that indicates that you are not absorbing\\nthese minerals. The culprit is overaccumulation of toxins (ama) in the colon.\\nA safe and simple way to cleanse the colon of the ama is to regularly take the herbal\\ncompound \\ntriphala\\n (see \\nappendix 2\\n). Steep about ½ teaspoon in ½ to 1 full cup of warm\\nwater, strain, and drink. You can take this at night before going to bed, or steep it\\novernight in cold water and drink it ɹrst thing in the morning. It will gradually\\neliminate the ama.\\nAnother way to promote the growth and strength of your nails is to eat a handful of\\nwhite sesame seeds every day. A handful of sesame seeds contains about 1,200 mg. of\\ncalcium and magnesium.\\nEither one of the Ayurvedic herbs \\nashwagandha\\n \\nor \\nshatavari\\n (½ teaspoon) taken in a\\ncup of hot milk twice a day may also help to prevent brittle nails.\\nAerobic exercise such as swimming, jogging, or aerobic dance, or the sequence of\\nyoga postures known as the Sun Salutation (see illustration in \\nappendix 4\\n), should also\\nbe helpful. Exercise improves the circulation and helps carry the minerals to the tissue at\\nthe root of the nails.\\nBecause the nails are connected with the \\nasthi dhatu\\n (bone tissue), strengthening \\nasthi\\nwill be helpful. Taking \\ntriphala guggulu\\n tablets (200 mg.) twice a day, after lunch and\\ndinner, will help to strengthen your nails.\\nIn some individuals, brittle nails and bone loss go together. Speciɹcally, in women of\\nmenopausal age, brittle nails may suggest weakness in the \\nasthi dhatu\\n. So if you have\\nbrittle nails, it would be wise to investigate the possibility that osteoporosis may be\\ndeveloping.\\n \\nBurns\\n \\nMany people believe the best thing you can do for a burn is to put something fatty or\\ngreasy on it, such as butter. But this is not true. Any burn is pitta, the dosha of ɹre.

People with high cholesterol, who eat fried, fatty food and whose\\ndiet is excessively kapha-provoking, appear to be more likely to have it, as do\\nindividuals who use a lot of olive oil in their cooking. As cellulite may gradually lead to\\nobesity, this condition can be seen as an early phase of being overweight.\\nIn Ayurvedic terms, \\nmeda\\n agni (the agni or ɹery quality responsible for metabolizing\\nfat) under the skin becomes low. Unprocessed fatty molecules lodge there and create\\ncellulite. The Ayurvedic aim in treatment is to kindle or enliven the \\nmeda\\n agni.\\nEXERCISE\\n. Regular exercise is the ɹrst approach. Walking, swimming, or other aerobic\\nexercise is important, and at least some of the exercise should be “local” to the area\\nwhere the cellulite is forming. In other words, if cellulite is developing on the thighs,\\ndon’t restrict your exercise to weight lifting and upper-body development!\\nWATCH OUT FOR KAPHA\\n. Watch your diet and be sure it isn’t kapha-increasing (see \\nchapter\\n8\\n). Minimize dairy products, sweets, cold food and drinks, and fatty fried food. Strictly\\navoid olive oil in cooking.\\nVITAMIN K\\n. Rub vitamin K cream onto the skin. This cream will remove spider veins and'),\n",

This will help remove the cellulite.\\n \\nCholesterol\\n \\nHigh cholesterol means increased lipids (fats) in the blood. It is essentially a\\nmetabolic disorder. People having low liver function or diminished thyroid activity, who\\nhave taken steroids in the past, or whose diet is very kaphagenic, seem most prone to\\ndevelop high cholesterol.\\nYour cholesterol level should be below 200. About 160 to 190 is normal, but a\\ncholesterol reading of 200 or above is worrisome, as a high cholesterol level in the blood\\ntends to create plaque on the artery walls, resulting in atherosclerotic changes,\\ncardiovascular disorders, hypertension, stroke, and heart problems.\\nThere are two kinds of cholesterol, HDL (high-density lipoprotein), which is the\\n“good” cholesterol, and LDL (low-density lipoprotein), which is the “bad” cholesterol.\\nResearchers these days are saying that what is more important than the total level of\\ncholesterol, as a predictive factor for cardiovascular and other health problems, is the\\nratio of total cholesterol to HDL.\\nTo reduce high cholesterol levels, and to prevent cholesterol from building up any\\nhigher, follow these guidelines.\\nWATCH YOUR DIET\\n. Stick to a kapha-pacifying diet (\\nchapter 8\\n). No fatty fried food. No\\ncheese. No high-fat milk or yogurt. Minimize sweets and cold food and drinks. Use garlic\\nand onion in cooking.\\nGET REGULAR EXERCISE\\n. Each day from Monday to Friday, walk for at least half an hour. Go\\nswimming or participate in some other aerobic exercise at least three times each week.\\nJust by regulating diet and exercise, you can control cholesterol. But there is much\\nmore that you can do.\\nHERBS TO COMBAT CHOLESTEROL\\n. Garlic is eʃective against high cholesterol. Mix together 1\\nclove of fresh garlic chopped ɹne, ½ teaspoon grated ginger root, and ½ teaspoon lime\\njuice; eat before each meal.\\n• Drink a tea made of 1 teaspoon cinnamon and ¼ teaspoon of the herbal mixture\\ntrikatu\\n.

The body builds up an\\nexcess of cool and moist kapha qualities, resulting in congestion and a runny nose, and\\nat the same time it may suʃer from excess vata, which reduces agni (gastric ɹre),\\nleading to chills, loss of appetite, and/or poor digestion.'),\n",

This\\nexercise is called a Leg Lift. If you ɹnd it diɽcult to lift both legs together, you can lift\\none leg and then the other.

It is caused by insuɽcient ɹber in the diet, insuɽcient water intake, lack of\\nexercise, heavy meat eating, and numerous other factors. Constipation may create\\ndistension and discomfort, ɻatulence and pain, headache and bad breath, and may lead\\nto absorption of toxins from the colon. Thus it is best to prevent constipation by keeping\\nvata in balance.\\nFOLLOW THE VATA-PACIFYING DIET\\n. One of the best ways to prevent constipation, especially if\\nyou have a predominantly vata constitution, is to follow the vata-balancing diet (see\\nchapter 8\\n). Stay away from cold foods and drinks, dried fruit, salads, and most beans;\\nfavor warm foods, warm drinks, and well-cooked vegetables. Some oil in the diet is\\nhelpful.\\nTRIPHALA\\n. Probably the best Ayurvedic remedy for constipation is \\ntriphala\\n, a\\ncombination \\nof three herbs beneɹcial for all doshic types (see \\nappendix 2\\n). Most\\nproblems with constipation can be corrected by taking ½ to 1 teaspoon of \\ntriphala\\n at\\nnight. Steep the herbs in a cup of hot water for 5 to 10 minutes, and drink.\\nSome people ɹnd that taking \\ntriphala\\n at night creates a diuretic action and they have\\nto get up several times to urinate. If that happens to you, you can steep the \\ntriphala\\n in a\\ncup of warm water overnight and drink it ɹrst thing in the morning. Actually, the best\\ntime to take \\ntriphala\\n is in the very early morning, around 4 or 5 \\nA.M\\n., but do your best\\nwithin your daily schedule.\\nHere are some further recommendations to help relieve constipation:\\nSNACK ON FRUIT\\n. Many varieties of fruit can help remedy constipation. So in between\\nmeals, eat some fruit. A banana, for example, is a mild laxative. Two ripe yellow\\nbananas, taken between meals, will help relieve constipation. (But don’t eat the\\nbananas with meals. They don’t combine well with other foods. See \\nchapter 8\\n for tips on\\nhealthy food combining.)\\nNOTE\\n: Bananas should be eaten when ripe. You can tell a ripe banana by its\\nbright yellow skin. The inside will be studded with tiny black dots. Green\\nbananas are constipating and should be avoided. Also avoid eating bananas\\nonce the skin turns black. They are overripe.\\nAN APPLE A DAY KEEPS THE DOCTOR AWAY\\n. There is a lot of truth in this old folk saying. Apples are\\neʃective both to help regularize the bowels and to clean the tongue and teeth. To\\ncombat constipation, peel and thoroughly chew a raw apple about an hour after a meal.\\nAlso effective:\\nPineapple juice'),\n",

Fiber in the diet, such as wheat bran, oatmeal, or oat bran, will help\\nkeep the bowels regular. Don’t forget that fresh fruit and vegetables as well as whole\\ngrains are high in fiber, too.\\nMILK AND GHEE—MILD AND EFFECTIVE\\n. Taking 1 or 2 teaspoonfuls of ghee in a cup of hot milk at\\nbedtime is an eʃective but gentle means of relieving constipation. This is especially\\ngood for vata and pitta constitutions, but it may be too kapha-increasing for kapha\\ntypes to use regularly.\\nCASTOR OIL\\n. Castor oil can also be used, but only when the constipation is more\\nobstinate. At bedtime, make yourself a cup of ginger tea (either by boiling some fresh,\\nsliced ginger in water, or adding some powdered ginger to a cup of hot water), and then\\nadd 2 teaspoons of castor oil to the tea and drink it.\\nIf 2 teaspoons don’t bring the desired result, try the procedure again the next night,\\nincreasing the dose to 3 teaspoons, and then go to 4 teaspoons if necessary. Adjust your\\ndose according to what works.\\nSUGGESTION\\n: Use this castor oil laxative treatment on weekends, when you can\\nstay home!\\nCastor oil tends to create dependency, in the sense that once you use it, other\\npurgatives rarely work. That is why it is recommended to use castor oil for constipation\\nonly in severe cases or in emergencies, as a last resort, but not on a regular basis.\\nHowever, there is one way to avoid this dependency. Take 2 teaspoons of castor oil\\nwith 1 cup warm milk. This will give a good bowel movement without creating\\ndependency.\\nFLAXSEED\\n. At night, boil 1 tablespoon of ɻaxseed in a cup of water for at least 2 to 3\\nminutes. Then drink the whole cupful, including the tea and the seeds.\\nFOR CONSTIPATION IN CHILDREN\\n. Give the child 3 figs soaked in warm water.\\nFOR SEVERE CONSTIPATION\\n. If there is absolute constipation for three days, don’t use\\npurgatives. The use of drastic purgatives when constipation is severe can create an\\nintestinal obstruction or even perforation, which can be dangerous. A better approach is\\nto do an enema and then take steps to regulate the system.\\nDo the enema with plain warm water, or you can use \\ntriphala\\n tea or \\ndashamoola\\n tea\\ninstead of plain water.

In brief we can say that because of speciɹc etiological factors, vata from the colon,\\npitta from the intestine, or kapha from the stomach enters the general circulation and\\nlodges in the nervous system, interferes with normal functioning of the mind and\\nnervous system, and causes depression.\\nThe resulting depression may be vata, pitta, or kapha. Each of these three types of\\ndepression is treated in diʃerent ways, though the ɹrst step for each is to bring the diet\\nin line with the guidelines for vata-, pitta-, and kapha-pacifying diets (see \\nchapter 8\\n).\\nThis is important—please don’t overlook it!\\nVATA DEPRESSION\\nVata-type depression is generally associated with fear, anxiety, nervousness, and\\ninsomnia. The following home remedies will help dissolve a mild vata depression:\\n• Drink \\ndashamoola\\n tea. Steep 1 teaspoon of the herb \\ndashamoola\\n in 1 cup of hot\\nwater, and drink.

Do this \\nnasya\\n procedure morning and evening on\\nan empty stomach.\\n• Rubbing the top of the head and the soles of the feet with sesame oil is quite\\nsoothing to vata and healing for vata depression.\\n• Psychologically, one factor that sustains vata depression is loneliness. Try to spend\\nmore time relating to people; it will help lift the depression.\\nPITTA DEPRESSION\\nPitta-type depression is generally associated with anger, or with fear of failure, of\\nlosing control, or of making mistakes; it often involves thoughts of committing suicide. It\\nis serious; you should consult your doctor.\\nOf course it is possible to have a mild pitta depression, caused by failing an\\nexamination, not getting a promotion at work, or some such thing. A pitta person can\\nbe quite addicted to success and, when he or she doesn’t succeed, can easily become\\nupset and depressed.

For\\nexample, if the mother eats stale and leftover food, or food that is heavy to digest, then\\nher milk will become harder for the child to digest. As a general rule, Ayurveda suggests\\nthat when babies six months old or younger get diarrhea, the mother should follow a\\npitta-pacifying diet.\\nAN APPLE A DAY\\n … A baby’s diarrhea can usually be corrected simply by feeding the child\\nsome cooked apple. Remove the skin and seeds, cook the apple, and add ½ teaspoon\\nghee, a pinch of cardamom, and a small pinch of ginger. Stir it up well, and cool to\\nroom temperature.\\nSUGGESTION\\n: To feed this applesauce to your child, use a standard baby bottle.\\nWith a clean scissors, cut oʃ the tip of the nipple, making an opening large\\nenough for the applesauce to flow through.\\nMAKE WHEY\\n. Whey is a natural source of lactobacillus. Since a baby’s diarrhea is often\\ndue to altered ɻora in the gastrointestinal tract, the whey should help restore the normal\\nflora. It is also a good source of potassium and of calcium, which binds the stool.\\nBring 1 cup of milk to a boil; when it just begins to boil, squeeze a little lime juice\\n(about ½ teaspoon) into the pot. The milk \\nwill curdle. Then strain the thick part out by\\npouring the mixture through cheesecloth or a sieve.\\nThe remaining watery part is the whey. Giving 4 to 5 teaspoons of the whey to the\\nchild every 10 to 15 minutes should stop the diarrhea.\\n(The thick, solid part is a delicious fresh cheese called \\npaneer\\n, much used in Indian\\ncooking. Try it!)\\nA SIMPLE HERBAL REMEDY\\n. Another simple domestic remedy is to mix 1 teaspoon honey, ½\\nteaspoon ghee, a pinch of nutmeg, and a pinch of saffron.\\nPOPPYSEED PORRIDGE\\n. You can also make your child a porridge of poppy seeds. Bring ½ cup\\nmilk and ½ cup water to a boil, then add about 1 teaspoon poppy seeds. The seeds will\\nswell and become soft; they will make a nice, easily digested porridge. It is a good food\\nthat helps to stop diarrhea. As a bonus, your child will also sleep soundly.\\nT\\nIME TO\\n S\\nEE THE\\n D\\nOCTOR\\nIf your infant has diarrhea, watch him or her carefully. If bowel movements\\nare becoming less frequent and are ɹrmer and denser, your child is getting\\nbetter.

It may be due to a lack of sebaceous (oily)\\nsecretions; insuɽcient sweating; an excess of hot, sharp pitta; or too much vata.\\nExternal causes of dry skin include sun, wind, hot dry air, excess washing, and excess use\\nof soap or dishwashing soap.\\nMOISTURIZING CREAM MAY NOT BE THE ANSWER\\n. Many people use moisturizing creams to counteract\\ndry skin. But dryness of the skin usually comes from within rather than from external\\ncauses. For this reason, mere application of a moisturizer doesn’t truly solve the\\nproblem.\\nIn general, moisturizing creams work only temporarily. They stimulate secretions of\\nthe sebaceous glands, and for a while the skin \\nlooks soft and oily. But then the glands\\nbecome tired and exhausted, resulting in more dryness. You will have much greater\\nsuccess if you treat the dryness both externally, with natural oils, and internally, by\\nlubrication of the colon with oil enemas.\\nHere are several eʃective Ayurvedic home remedies to keep your skin smooth and\\nlustrous.\\nAPPLY SOME OIL\\n. In some cases, applying some oil to your skin may be all you need to\\neliminate dry skin. If your constitution is predominantly vata, apply sesame oil; if you\\nare pitta, apply sunflower or coconut oil. If you are kapha, apply corn oil.\\nHowever, application of oil to the skin will probably not be suɽcient. To treat the\\ninternal cause of the dryness, you’ll have to lubricate the colon with a gentle oil enema.\\nOIL ENEMA\\n. Here is the procedure:\\n• \\nStep 1:\\n Begin with a cleansing enema. Either in the morning or evening, give\\nyourself a regular water enema. After a good bowel movement, wait one hour before\\nproceeding to step 2.'),\n",

Inject the oil into the rectum (using a hot\\nwater bottle or a syringe), and try to retain it for 5 to 10 minutes. If it goes out, don’t\\nworry, let it out. (More complete guidelines on how to do an enema are in \\nappendix 3\\n.)\\nThis simple oil enema will make your skin soft, delicate, and gorgeous. The colon is\\nan important part of the absorption process for food nutrients.

Leave it on for 15 minutes, and then rinse oʃ.\\nThis will give you a beautiful complexion.\\n \\nEarache\\n \\nIf the ear passage gets dried and crusty due to excess vata, it may start aching. The\\neardrum may even become tight and painful.\\nHowever, before treating earache, it is important to first rule out several possibilities,\\nsuch as infection \\n(otitis externa\\n or \\notitis interna)\\n, perforated eardrum, or excess wax\\ncausing pressure on the ear (see “\\nEarwax\\n”). Having ruled these out, one can then treat\\nthe vata problem.\\nTEA TREE OIL\\n. Begin by pulling down on the lobe of your painful ear. If this hurts, it\\nmeans there is \\notitis externa\\n, external ear infection. To heal the infection, take a cotton\\nswab and dip it into tea tree oil, a wonderful natural disinfectant widely available at\\nnatural food stores and some pharmacies. Then apply the oil to the ear with the swab.\\nNOTE\\n: Using plain tea tree oil may create a burning sensation on sensitive\\nskin, so it is usually best to dilute it, using 10 to 20 drops of tea tree oil mixed in\\n1 ounce of sesame oil.\\nTEA TREE OIL WITH \\nNEEM\\n.\\n For an even more eʃective treatment, combine the tea\\ntree oil with \\nneem\\n oil. Here again, don’t use pure \\nneem\\n extract. Mix 10 to 20 drops of\\nneem\\n in sesame oil, then add it to the tea tree oil. Gently apply a few drops of the oil\\nmixture to the ear passage.'),\n",

It has the function of protecting\\nthe eardrum from dust, and it also keeps the ear canal lubricated. But because it is\\nconstantly exposed to the air, the wax may accumulate dust and dirt and become tarry\\nblack or brown-black and thick, packed tightly into the ear canal. It may obstruct\\nhearing or create uncomfortable pressure, and so it has to be periodically removed.\\nWASH IT OUT\\n. Gentle irrigation of the ear canal with warm water will usually take care of\\nit. You can pick up an ear syringe in a pharmacy quite inexpensively. Prepare a pint of\\nwarm water (body temperature), add about ½ teaspoon of baking soda, and use that\\nwater to clean the ear. Follow the directions that come with the syringe, which\\nessentially are to hold the syringe at the edge of the ear canal (do not insert it; the water\\nhas to be free to come out again), and squirt the water \\ngently\\n into the ear.

Do a final rinse with plain warm water.\\nAfter irrigating the ear, it is important to dry the ear thoroughly. A good way is to\\ndip a cotton swab into some rubbing alcohol, and wipe the ear with the swab.\\nSOFTEN IT WITH OIL\\n. Sometimes the wax is stubborn and doesn’t come out easily. In that\\ncase, for a day or two before doing the irrigation, soften the wax in the ear canal by\\nlubricating it with warm garlic oil. Take about 1 tablespoon of sesame oil, add ½ clove\\nof freshly chopped garlic, and boil it until the garlic pieces turn brown. It will have a\\npleasant smell. Then press the oil from the garlic, and strain it into a jar or other\\ncontainer. (Plain sesame oil will also work, but the garlic oil will be more effective.)\\nThen, 2 or 3 times a day, put a few drops of that oil—when it is warm, not hot—into\\nthe ear. That will lubricate the ear passage and soften the wax for easy removal.\\nDISSOLVE IT WITH HYDROGEN PEROXIDE\\n. You can also use a mild hydrogen peroxide solution\\n(about a 3 percent solution) to dissolve the wax. You can buy this solution in most\\npharmacies. Put a few drops in the ear. It will oxygenate the ear, and the wax will\\nsimply dissolve. When you’re finished, clean the ear with some warm sesame oil.\\nMASSAGE TO LOOSEN STUBBORN WAX\\n. For stubborn earwax, massage the outside of the ear. Put a\\nlittle sesame oil or castor oil on the mastoid bone (the bone behind the ear), and gently\\nmassage. Pull the ear lobe, and at the same time open your mouth. This will help to\\nloosen the ear wax, and it will come out quite easily when you irrigate with water.\\nHERBAL REMEDY\\n. The root cause of excessive earwax production is increased vata in the\\nmamsa dhatu\\n (muscle tissue). To deal with this, take \\ntriphala guggulu\\n tablets, 200 mg.\\ntwice a day, for one month. That will deɹnitely break down the body’s habit of forming\\nexcess earwax.\\nPREVENTION\\n. Here is another excellent way to prevent the buildup of earwax. Once a\\nmonth, sleep on your left side. Fill your right ear with warm sesame oil, and go to bed.\\n(Put an old towel on the pillow to catch the excess oil.) The whole night, the ear passage\\nwill be soaked in the sesame oil. The wax will rise up toward the surface of the ear\\ncanal, and you can clean it out in the morning with a dry cotton swab. (Don’t stay\\nawake all night trying not to turn over; just sleep comfortably. Even a couple of hours\\nwith the oil filling the canal will do the trick.)\\nThe next night, sleep on the other side and treat the other ear in the same way.

Individuals\\nwho work in front of a computer for a long time, watch a lot of TV or movies, or do a\\nlot of driving or close-up work, or who live in a city with high air pollution, may ɹnd\\nthat their eyes become irritated and build up quite a lot of strain.\\nThe irritation may be due to dryness of the conjunctiva (which results from excess\\nvata), or it may be related to excess hyperacidity or pitta in the stomach. Or, because\\nthe liver and eyes are closely related, high or stagnant pitta in the liver may be a causal\\nfactor. It is important to pin down the cause in order to treat it with maximum\\neffectiveness. But most of the following remedies will be helpful in all situations.\\nTAKE A BREAK\\n. If you are using your eyes a lot, perhaps in front of a computer or driving,\\nstop every hour or two for a few minutes to give your eyes a rest.\\nUSE A PROTECTIVE SCREEN\\n. Use a protective screen on your video terminal, to cut radiation\\nand glare.\\nCHANGE YOUR FOCUS\\n. If you are doing a lot of reading, stop for a minute or two and\\nrefocus on a distant object. Every half hour, close the book and look at something across\\nthe room or out the window. Doing something diʃerent with the eyes is restful and will\\nhelp prevent eye irritation.\\nTAKE A TEA BREAK\\n. In the midst of a lot of close-up work or sitting at the computer, stop\\nfor a few minutes and have a cup of tea: chamomile, comfrey, mint, or even \\nchai\\n (which\\nhas some caʃeine and will not be as soothing as the other three). This will be relaxing\\nand will help to relieve the irritation and strain.\\nROSE WATER EYE DROPS\\n. You can also prepare a solution of rose water. Take 1 ounce of\\ndistilled or puriɹed water, add 5 drops of pure rose water, and use the solution to rinse\\nyour eyes. Use a dropper or an eye cup, and be sure the water is neither too cold nor too\\nhot. This solution will immediately soothe any eye irritation.\\nSPLASH YOUR EYES WITH WATER\\n.

Rubbing a little castor oil on the soles\\nof your feet at bedtime also helps; remember to wear some old socks to prevent the oil\\nfrom staining your sheets.\\nFOR BLOODSHOT EYES\\n. If your eyes are irritated and bloodshot, drink a cup of fresh orange\\njuice with ½ teaspoon of natural sugar and a pinch of cumin.\\nTO PACIFY ACIDITY\\n. If excess acid and high pitta in your system seems to be the cause of the\\neye irritation, take some \\nshatavari\\n (½ teaspoon), add just a pinch of \\nshanka bhasma\\n, and\\ntake it twice a day for 2 weeks, with a little warm water.\\n• Aloe vera gel (2 tablespoons 3 times a day) also pacifies acidity.\\n• If you determine that high pitta might be the cause of the eye irritation, make a\\nmixture of the herbs \\nshanka pushpi\\n and \\njatamamsi\\n in equal proportions. Take ½ teaspoon\\ntwice a day for 2 weeks.\\n \\nEyes-Ayurvedic Care\\n \\nAyurveda has a number of excellent suggestions for maintaining your eyes in\\nstrength and health.\\nCOOL WATER WASH\\n. Early in the morning, when you wash your face, ɹll your mouth \\nwith\\ncool water and hold it there; then splash cool water over your open eyes. Traditionally,\\nyou’re not supposed to swallow or spit out the water, but keep it in your mouth as you\\nsprinkle the cool water on your eyes. This has a double cooling eʃect, both from outside\\nand from the oral cavity, that will make your eyes feel fresh, happy, and cheerful. (If\\nyou prefer, you can use an eye cup instead.)\\nGHEE LAMP\\n. A traditional Ayurvedic way to strengthen and soothe the eyes is to gaze at\\nthe ɻame of a ghee lamp.

Apply a little ghee to\\nthe tip of the wick and then light it.\\nAyurvedic Eye Exercises\\nThe following exercises will strengthen your eyes.\\n• First, blink the eyes rapidly several times. Then, with eyes open, move your\\neyes in this pattern:\\nup and down\\nside to side\\ndiagonally from top left to bottom right\\ndiagonally from top right to bottom left\\nclockwise in a circle\\ncounterclockwise in a circle\\n• Hold your arm outstretched in front of you. Look at the tip of your index\\nɹnger, and gradually bring the ɹnger close to you, following it with your eyes,\\nuntil it touches your “third eye,” between the eyebrows.\\n• Look at the tip of your nose, and then up toward your “third eye.”\\n• Finally, close your eyes tightly, then release. These exercises are beneɹcial for\\nimproving the circulation of the eccentric muscles of the eyeball.\\nAfter ɹnishing the exercises, or anytime your eyes feel tired or strained, rub\\nyour palms vigorously together for a few seconds to generate some warmth, then\\nplace them \\nlightly\\n over your eyes. Feel how soothing the warmth is! Keep them there\\nfor a minute or two to strengthen and nourish your eyes.\\nSet the ghee lamp at a distance of 2 or 3 feet from you, remove your glasses, and\\ngaze at the ɻame for 2 or 3 minutes \\nwithout blinking\\n. This procedure will improve the\\ntejas\\n or lustrous quality of the eyes.\\nSALUTE THE SUN\\n. Another eʃective way to keep eyes strong is to do the Sun Salutation\\nexercise.

For eyestrain, Ayurveda also suggests taking a sterilized cotton ball or a\\npiece of gauze, dipping it into cool goat’s milk, and putting it over your closed eyes. This\\nwill ease stress and make your eyes feel better. (If goat’s milk is not available, you may\\nuse cow’s milk, but goat’s milk is preferable.)\\nADDITIONAL SUGGESTIONS\\nREAD SITTING UP\\n. While reading, keep your vertebral column straight. Avoid reading while\\nlying down.\\nUSE A NONGLARE COMPUTER SCREEN\\n.

There are two types of dizziness:\\nIn the ɹrst kind, one feels that external objects in the environment are moving: “I am\\nstill, but the room is moving around me.” That is called \\nobjective dizziness\\n, and it is\\nprimarily due to aggravated vata.\\nThe second type is called \\nsubjective dizziness\\n. Here, one has the feeling of swinging or\\ndisequilibrium, of being subjectively in motion. This type of dizziness is caused primarily\\nby excess pitta. The diʃerence between the two is subtle and not easy to pinpoint,\\nespecially since vata and pitta are both always involved. But it is helpful to distinguish\\nbetween the two, as some aspects of treatment will be different.\\nT\\nIME TO\\n S\\nEE THE\\n D\\nOCTOR\\nThe remedies in this section are simple, eʃective means of relieving dizziness.\\nBut if dizziness or fainting persists after using them, it would be wise to see a\\nneurologist or another medical expert, because the dizziness might be due to\\nsome serious pathology.\\nVertigo, a spinning, merry-go-round kind of feeling, may be related to infection in\\nthe inner ear, head injury, or viral infection. It may be due to Ménière’s disease, a\\ncondition in which increased pressure in the middle ear generates a feeling of vertigo.\\nMénière’s disease will result in progressive hearing loss if it’s not treated. All these\\nconditions have to be suspected and ruled out before undertaking home treatment for\\ndizziness. However, the domestic remedies below will help most cases of dizziness.\\nDizziness or feeling faint may also occur when there is insuɽcient oxygen in the\\nroom.\\nIf you feel dizzy and you’re not sure whether you’re spinning or the room is moving,\\nfocus on a ɹxed point, such as a window frame. When the eyeball becomes steady by\\nfocusing on a stable point, it sends a message to the brain that calms down the \\nrajasic\\nquality of vata dosha. This works well for objective dizziness.\\nThe kind of dizziness known as \\nmotion sickness\\n is often associated with nausea and\\nvomiting. To help with motion sickness, before starting the trip, take one 00-size capsule\\nɹlled with ginger powder. Bring some more along on the trip. You might also bring\\nsome candied ginger and chew on a piece of it from time to time. If you are in a car and\\nyou feel that everything seems to be in motion, try to look at a ɹxed point, such as the\\nhorizon \\nor a distant unmoving object. This should help to stop the dizziness.\\nSometimes people feel dizzy when they stand up quickly.

If a person faints, collapses, and becomes unconscious, sprinkle\\nsome cold water on the face.\\nDIZZINESS FROM EXERCISING\\n. Individuals who exercise vigorously may become dehydrated\\nfrom sweating a lot, which may bring on dizziness. The cure for this is about as simple\\nas it gets: Drink some water. Even just one glass of cool water will help to reduce pitta\\nas well as correct the dehydration, and the dizziness will subside.\\nDEEP BREATHING\\n. Another simple remedy for dizziness is breathing deeply, as in \\nujjayi\\npranayama\\n (see \\nchapter 6\\n) and holding the breath behind the belly button.\\nEAR PULL\\n. Here’s another simple remedy: Insert your index ɹnger into your ear and\\ngently pull the ear upward, forward, and downward. This will regulate intracranial\\npressure, which will greatly if not entirely relieve the feeling of faintness or dizziness.\\nNATURAL SMELLING SALTS\\n. For dizziness or when feeling faint, slice or chop up an onion and\\ninhale the smell forcibly until tears come to your eyes. Onions contain a lot of ammonia;\\ninhaling them produces vasodilation, which brings more blood supply to the brain, and\\ndizziness is automatically corrected.\\nHERBAL FORMULAS\\n.

However, it is not always due to overwork. In\\nfact, sometimes people feel tired because they’re not doing enough, not working hard\\nenough. For such people, fatigue can be due to boredom or lack of motivation.\\nIn such cases, I’ve had to ask patients to walk or to do some physical work in order\\nto get rid of fatigue and increase their energy level. So the ɹrst thing to determine is\\nwhether the tiredness is due to too much physical work or too much idleness!\\nFatigue may be due to low gastric ɹre, weakness of the liver, low adrenal energy, or\\nanemia. It may be caused by Epstein-Barr virus, a form of chronic fatigue syndrome\\nrelated to high stagnant pitta in the liver. People having a history of infectious\\nmononucleosis can feel very tired.\\nHere are some treatment recommendations for fatigue of various causes:\\nFOR FATIGUE AFTER EXERCISE OR HARD PHYSICAL WORK\\n. Drink a cup of fresh orange juice with a pinch\\nof rock salt. Adding 10 drops of fresh lime juice will help pacify pitta.\\n• Drinking 1 cup of ginseng or \\nashwagandha\\n tea once or twice a day will help.\\nFOR ANEMIA\\n. If the fatigue is due to anemia, treat the anemia with blood builders such as\\npomegranate juice, grapes and/or grape juice, beets or beet/carrot juice, or the herbs\\nabrak bhasma\\n and \\nloha bhasma\\n.

You will usually ɹnd,\\naccording to Ayurvedic dietetics, that you have reactions to foods with the same doshic\\nquality as your constitution, particularly if you have an excess of that quality at the\\npresent time.\\nDETERMINING YOUR FOOD ALLERGY TYPE\\nThe following descriptions should help you determine the type of food allergy you\\nhave.\\n• Kapha-type individuals, with excess kapha in their system, will be allergic to kapha\\nfoods, including dairy products such as milk, yogurt, and cheese; wheat; cucumber; and\\nwatermelon. Their food allergies may manifest as heaviness in the stomach, slow\\ndigestion, sleeping disorders, colds, congestion, cough, or water retention. In more\\nserious conditions kapha food allergies may lead to bronchial congestion and kapha-\\ntype asthma.'),\n",

Their symptoms are likely to include heartburn, acid\\nindigestion, stomach upset, nausea, and even vomiting. The person may suddenly get\\nhot flashes, and may have bloodshot eyes.\\n• Vata individuals, especially when vata is in excess, are prone to get allergies to raw\\nfoods; beans (black beans, adzuki beans, pinto beans, and so on) and certain animal\\nproteins. Vata food allergies are likely to manifest as bloating of the stomach, burping,\\ngas, gurgling of the stomach, and vague abdominal discomfort and pain. It may also\\nlead to insomnia and nightmares, pain in the joint, sciatica, muscle twitching, and\\nmuscle spasms.\\nSo food allergies need to be studied according to an individual’s \\nprakruti\\n(constitution) and \\nvikruti\\n (current status of the doshas).\\nTREATMENT\\nThe best approach is simply to avoid the problematic food items and to follow the\\ndiet appropriate for your body type. For example, a vata person having vata-type food\\nallergies should avoid a vata-provoking diet and should eat vata-pacifying foods. The\\nsame is true for pitta and kapha. (See the diet recommendations in \\nchapter 8\\n.)\\nHere are some additional suggestions for each of the three main types of food\\nallergy.\\nFOR VATA-TYPE FOOD ALLERGIES\\n. An eʃective way to help bring vata food allergies under\\ncontrol is to take a \\ndashamoola basti\\n (enema) twice a week, such as on Sunday and\\nThursday. Boil up 1 pint of water with 1 tablespoon of \\ndashamoola\\n, and use the resulting\\ntea (after it cools down) for the enema. Try to retain the liquid at least 10 minutes. (For\\nmore on enemas, see \\nappendix 3\\n.) This herbal enema will help to pacify vata and\\nremove toxicity from the colon, and vata-type \\nfood allergies can be minimized. Continue\\ntaking the \\ndashamoola\\n enema twice a week for one month.\\nDrinking licorice tea made from ½ teaspoon licorice root powder, ½ teaspoon honey,\\nand 1 teaspoon ghee can also be helpful. Sip a little of the tea every half hour to an hour\\nthroughout the day until symptoms are relieved. Don’t forget to add the honey only after\\nthe tea starts to cool; honey should never be cooked. \\nNote:\\n People with high blood\\npressure should not drink licorice tea. Substitute ½ teaspoon cinnamon and 2 to 3 cloves\\nfor the licorice, and make the tea as above.\\nFOR PITTA FOOD ALLERGIES\\n. To control pitta food allergies, it is helpful to do \\nvirechana chikitsa\\n(purgation). Take 1 teaspoon of \\namalaki\\n or \\nsat isabgol\\n (psyllium husks) at night. Add the\\nherbs to 1 cup of hot water, let it stand for 10 to 15 minutes, and drink. Stagnation of\\npitta in the small intestine is the root cause of a pitta-type food allergy. Purgation'),\n",

Continue\\nwith \\nvirechana\\n daily for a month, or until the allergy subsides.\\nYou will also ɹnd it helpful to eat cooked apples. Peel and core a couple of apples,\\ncook them a few minutes to soften them, and mash them up with a pinch of cumin and 1\\nteaspoon ghee. Eat about ½ cup once or twice daily, at least an hour before or after\\nmeals.\\nFOR KAPHA FOOD ALLERGIES\\n. The Ayurvedic puriɹcation known as \\nvamana\\n (vomiting) will be\\nhelpful. Every Sunday (or at least for a couple of weeks) in the early morning, drink 2\\npints of salt water. Add 2 teaspoons of salt to 2 pints of water, drink it down, and then\\ntry to vomit it out. (Rubbing the back part of your tongue until you get a “gag” reɻex\\nwill help.) This puriɹcation process will remove a lot of excess mucus from the stomach\\nand help to clear up food allergies.\\nIf vomiting doesn’t take place, don’t worry about it; the remaining salty water won’t\\nhurt you. It will simply go through your system and will actually have some beneɹcial\\ncleansing effect.\\nNOTE\\n: Many people feel a lot of fear or discomfort with the idea or the\\nactuality of vomiting. If you feel this way, do not force yourself to do this\\npurification. Do \\nvamana\\n only if it is comfortable for you to do so.\\nKaphas should also fast on Sunday. The fasting is important; it will help cleanse the\\nsystem.\\nMake a tea out of ½ teaspoon licorice root powder, ¼ teaspoon cinnamon, and ½\\nteaspoon coriander. Steep in 1 cup of water for 10 minutes, strain, and sip a little of the\\ntea throughout the day, about an ounce every half hour to an hour. Again, people with\\nhigh blood pressure should not drink licorice tea. Substitute ½ teaspoon cinnamon and 2\\nto 3 cloves for the licorice.\\nFOR ALL FOOD ALLERGIES\\n. If you don’t know whether the allergy is vata, pitta, or kapha,\\nthen try this simple remedy that is eʃective for all types: Roast some cumin, fennel, and\\nwhite sesame seeds, and eat a handful after meals.\\nTo prepare the mixture, take one ounce of each kind of seed, and dry-roast it\\nseparately\\n \\n(one type at a time) on a heavy cast-iron pan. You will have to stir the seeds\\nconstantly to keep them from burning. The fennel takes a few minutes, the others only\\nabout a minute or two before they become fragrant and slightly brown. Put the seeds\\ntogether, add about ½ teaspoon rock salt (don’t use sea salt), and mix it all up. Store in\\na glass jar.\\nChewing a little of this mixture after eating any food will aid digestion and help\\nprevent any kind of food allergy.'),\n",

When the\\nuterus becomes enlarged due to the growth of the fetus in the womb, it creates pressure\\non the bladder. The bladder hasn’t got suɽcient space to accumulate urine and expand,\\nso just a little accumulation stimulates the desire for relief.\\nIf frequent urination disturbs the woman’s sleep, this is not good, as she needs her\\nrest.

Gallstones begin with stagnation of bile in the gallbladder. The bile\\nbecomes thick, accumulates, coagulates, and slowly leads to stone formation.\\nPrevention of gallstones, and what to do when gallstones are present, are two\\ndiʃerent lines of treatment. First let’s consider what to do when gallstones have already\\ndeveloped.\\nTO ALLEVIATE THE PAIN\\n. In general, gallstones are not painful. They may remain in the\\ngallbladder for a long time without causing any pain; indeed, you will not know they\\nare there. Pain occurs when the gallbladder tries to push the stones out of the\\ngallbladder through the bile duct.\\nTo reduce pain, put a warm castor oil pack on your abdomen. Castor oil produces a\\nslow, sustained heat that is soothing and healing. Warm up about 3 tablespoons of\\ncastor oil and pour it onto a handkerchief or \\nother soft cloth, spreading it equally on the\\ncloth. Place this compress on the abdomen above the gallbladder (on the right side of\\nyour abdomen, above the line of your navel and below the ribs). If you have a hot water\\nbottle, you may place it on top of the pack to keep it warm. (Electric heating pads are\\nnot recommended.)\\nFOR ACUTE ATTACK\\n. During an acute gallstone attack, use this herbal formula:\\nmusta 4 parts\\ntrikatu 3 parts\\nguduchi 6 parts\\nTake ¼ teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day with honey. It will reduce\\nthe pain and ease the gallbladder attack.\\nLIVER FLUSH TO ELIMINATE THE GALLSTONE\\n. When the pain is gone, you can do a liver ɻush to\\nwash out the gallstone. This liver ɻush should not be done if the stone is large, \\nso before\\ndoing the treatment it is vital to get an ultrasound report on the exact size of the gallstone and\\nconsult with your physician about using the treatment\\n. If it is a small and recently formed\\nstone, this treatment will help. If it is quite large, such as 3 to 4 mm. in diameter, then\\nthe flushing treatment will not be good.\\nT\\nIME TO\\n S\\nEE THE\\n D\\nOCTOR\\nIMPORTANT\\n: This liver-ɻushing treatment should \\nnot\\n be done without the\\napproval and guidance of your physician or the direct supervision of an\\nAyurvedic physician. Otherwise, you may damage the gallbladder and\\nexperience dangerous complications.\\nCombine 8 ounces olive oil, 4 ounces lemon juice, a chopped fresh garlic clove, and'),\n",

Drink this entire mixture in the early morning (at about six\\no’clock) on an empty stomach. Don’t eat anything until at least noon. If you feel thirsty,\\ndrink hot water or a little lime juice.\\nThe treatment is a shock to the gallbladder, which contracts and squeezes the\\ngallstone(s) out into the duodenum.\\nThat night, take ½ teaspoon of \\ntriphala\\n with warm water. The next day you will pass\\nsome green stuʃ in the stools. This is thick, coagulated bile containing the gallstone\\ncrystals.\\nPREVENTION OF GALLSTONES\\n. In order to prevent gallstone formation, one has to improve both\\nthyroid function and metabolism. In general, the following formula is effective:\\npunarnava 5 parts\\nshatavari 4 parts\\nkutki 2 parts\\nchitrak 2 parts\\nmusta 3 parts\\nshilajit ¼ part\\nThis mixture (¼ teaspoon 3 times a day with honey), taken regularly for 2 to\\n3 months, will help to prevent gallstone formation.\\nYOGA POSTURES\\n. Several yoga \\nasanas\\n are beneɹcial for prevention of gallstones. The Bow\\npose, Peacock pose, Spinal Twist, and Narayan pose (lying on the left side) will help to\\nempty the gallbladder. (For illustrations \\nof yoga postures, see \\nappendix 4\\n.) These\\npostures will improve circulation in the gallbladder, helping to prevent the\\ncrystallization process.\\nDIET\\n. Stay away from deep-fried food, dairy products such as yogurt and cheese, and\\nall fatty foods, especially animal fat and any saturated fat. These accelerate coagulation\\nof bile into gallstones.\\n \\nGas and Flatulence\\n \\nNo one under the sun is exempt from ɻatulence. Every person at some time or\\nanother gets gases and disturbances in the colon.\\nWe are all vulnerable to this condition for several reasons. First, the colon is the\\nmain seat of vata dosha, the dosha that is derived from ether and air. If vata increases in\\nthe colon, due to eating vata-aggravating foods, cold weather, anxiety, insomnia, and\\nother factors, gases may build up. Also, whenever we eat anything, we swallow a small\\namount of air, which increases vata. And any food we eat undergoes slight'),\n",

Grate some fresh ginger root until you have about 1 teaspoon of pulp,\\nand add 1 teaspoon of lime juice. Take this mixture immediately after eating.\\nLEMON JUICE REMEDY\\n. Another simple method to reduce excess gas is to stir 1 teaspoon\\nlemon juice and ½ teaspoon baking soda into 1 cup cool water. Drink it down quickly,\\nright after meals, for best results! (It forms carbon dioxide, which facilitates digestion.)\\nCUMIN-FENNEL-CELERY SEED MIXTURE\\n. Prepare a mixture of roasted cumin, fennel, and \\najwan\\nseeds (Indian celery seed) in equal proportions. (See \\nthis page\\n-\\nthis page\\n for suggested\\nmethod of preparation of roasted seeds.) After each meal, take about ½ to 1 teaspoon of\\nthis mixture, chew well, and swallow with about ⅓ cup warm water.\\nCHARCOAL TABLETS\\n. Another simple remedy is charcoal tablets, which you can buy in most\\nhealth food stores. Swallow two tablets after lunch and dinner. The charcoal absorbs\\ngases and helps to prevent flatulence.\\nHERBAL TABLETS\\n. Ayurveda also suggests the herbs \\nshankavati\\n and \\nlasunadivati\\n. These herbs\\nare useful for an aching stomach and are helpful to reduce ɻatulence. Take 1 tablet\\n(available from most sources of Ayurvedic herbs) at night for 5 days.\\nDIETARY GUIDELINES\\n. Flatulence is mostly a vata condition, so following a vata-pacifying\\ndiet can help prevent it. Avoid raw foods, cold food and drinks, and most beans. (See\\nchapter 8\\n for guidelines.) Fermented foods also increase gases in the colon, so it’s best to\\navoid them.\\nIRIPHALA\\n.\\n Finally, it is helpful to take the herbal compound \\ntriphala\\n. At night before\\ngoing to bed, steep ½ to 1 teaspoon \\ntriphala\\n \\nin a cup of boiling hot water for 5 to 10\\nminutes, then drink it.\\n \\nGlaucoma\\n \\nIncreasing intraocular pressure, due to accumulation of kapha dosha in the vitreous\\nhumor (the viscous ɻuid inside the eyeball), is called glaucoma. When glaucoma is\\noccurring in an eye, palpation will show a tenseness in that eye. If pressure in the eye\\nbecomes high, headaches may occur. Glaucoma may become a serious condition and can\\ncause blindness, so one has to be very watchful.\\nIn persons who lift heavy weights (either at work or for exercise), who strain in\\nexercise, who have high cholesterol or high triglycerides, or who have diabetes or\\nnicotine toxicity due to smoking, intraocular pressure has a tendency to increase and\\nmay lead to glaucoma.'),\n",

That headache will be more in\\nthe temple or temporal area.\\nBecause of a kapha-producing diet, systemic kapha in the stomach increases, enters\\ninto the general circulation, and can lodge in the sinuses and create kapha-type sinus\\nheadaches. Kapha headaches tend to be more in the frontal and nasal areas of the head.\\nHeadaches can also be due to ear problems, eye problems, insomnia, food allergies,\\nexposure to cold temperatures, tension in the neck, or working too long (for instance, in\\nfront of a computer) in a wrong position. Even using two pillows below the head for\\nsleeping can cause headaches.\\nClearly the causes are extremely varied.

Putting 3 to 5 drops of warm ghee in each nostril will help reduce vata and\\nwill be effective for soothing your headache (see \\nappendix 3\\n).\\nNIGHTTIME FOOT AND SCALP MASSAGE\\n. Before you go to sleep at night, rub some sesame oil\\ngently on the top of your head and on the soles of your feet. This is one of the most\\neffective ways to keep vata under control.\\nIN CASE OF DEHYDRATION\\n. Vata headache is frequently associated with dehydration,\\nespecially if you have just gone to a higher altitude. If dehydration has occurred, make\\nsome homemade dextrosaline: Mix 1 tablespoon sugar, ¼ teaspoon salt, and about 10\\ndrops of lime juice in a pint of water and drink it. The moment the dehydration is\\ncorrected, a vata headache will disappear or at least be greatly reduced.\\nA SOOTHING PASTE\\n. If, after this treatment, the headache does not subside, then take ¼\\nteaspoon nutmeg powder in your palm, and add suɽcient water to make a paste by\\nrubbing your hands together. Apply the paste to your forehead. Leave it on for about\\nhalf an hour and then wash it off. This should help to soothe a vata-type headache.\\nFOLLOW THE VATA-BALANCING DIET\\n. Remember that if you are prone to vata headaches and\\nother vata-related problems such as constipation and insomnia, following a vata-\\npacifying diet will help a lot (see \\nchapter 8\\n).\\nFOR PITTA-TYPE HEADACHES\\n. Pitta headaches start in the temple area and go to the central\\npart of the head. A pitta headache is characterized by shooting, burning, piercing, or\\npenetrating pain, and it is worsened by bright light, hot sun, or high temperatures, or by\\neating sour fruits, pickles, or highly spicy food. It may be associated with nausea and/or'),\n",

A pitta headache is\\noften felt behind the eyes and may be associated with dizziness.\\nThese headaches are related to the stomach and intestines.\\nALOE VERA\\n. If you have a pitta-type headache, take 2 tablespoons of aloe vera gel, up to\\n3 times in a day.\\nA COOLING TEA\\n. Drinking cumin-coriander tea (equal amounts of each, about 1 teaspoon\\nof the mixture per cup) can help to relieve a pitta-type headache. Let the tea cool to\\nroom temperature before you drink it.\\nA COOLING PASTE\\n. This cooling paste may help to quickly relieve a pitta headache. Mix 1\\nteaspoon sandalwood powder with suɽcient water to make a paste, and apply it to\\nyour forehead and/or temples. Leave it on your skin for about half an hour, then wash it\\noff.\\nSOOTHING GHEE \\nNASYA\\n. A few drops of warm ghee placed in the nostrils will be beneɹcial\\nfor soothing a pitta-type headache.\\nEAT SOMETHING SWEET\\n. Sometimes a pitta headache responds quickly if you just have\\nsomething sweet to eat. Try a piece of sweet fruit, or some ice cream.\\nNIGHTTIME MINIMASSAGE\\n. At night, rub a little \\nbhringaraj\\n oil or \\nbrahmi\\n oil on the soles of your\\nfeet and on your scalp. Take precautions not to get oil on your pillow and sheets.\\nCOVER YOUR HEAD\\n. If you have a pitta-type headache—or are prone to getting them—don’t\\nwalk or work in the sun without wearing a hat. A hat on your head protects against\\naggravating pitta and helps to prevent the headache.\\nFOR KAPHA-TYPE HEADACHES\\nIf your headache occurs in winter or spring, strikes in the morning or evening, and\\ngets worse when you bend down, it is a kapha headache. It is often associated with sinus\\ncongestion and clogging of the nose, and it often accompanies a cold or a cough. It may\\ngo along with hay fever and other allergies. The pain of a kapha headache is usually\\ndull and deep-seated. It starts in the upper frontal area of the skull, moves down to the\\nforehead, and sometimes comes down to the sinuses.\\nEUCALYPTUS STEAM\\n. To immediately relieve a kapha headache, put 10 drops of eucalyptus\\noil in boiled water, cover your head with a towel, and inhale the steam. This helps to\\nrelieve the congestion and often completely takes care of the headache. Ginger steam—\\nboiling fresh ginger or dried ginger powder and then inhaling the steam—is also\\neffective.\\nUSE THIS WARMING PASTE\\n. A warming ginger paste can be quite helpful. Take 1 teaspoon\\nginger powder, mix together with suɽcient water to form a paste, and apply it to your'),\n",

You can also put some of the paste across the bridge of your nose and over\\nyour cheekbones. A paste of \\nvacha\\n powder (calamus) is also helpful and is preferable for\\npitta individuals, as the ginger powder may burn their skin. Leave the paste on for\\nabout half an hour, then wash it oʃ. \\nBe careful when washing oʃ ginger paste:\\n Avoid\\ngetting any in your eyes.\\nNOTE\\n: Ginger paste can sometimes create a burning sensation on the skin,\\nespecially in pitta individuals. It is not dangerous, but if you begin to feel an\\nuncomfortable burning feeling, wash the ginger off with warm water.\\nA PASTE FOR SINUS HEADACHES\\n. For sinus headaches (usually related to kapha), make a paste\\nout of ½ teaspoon cinnamon and sufficient water, and apply it locally.\\nSALTWATER REMEDY\\n. For some individuals, a kapha-type headache can be quickly relieved\\nby this simple remedy: Mix 1 teaspoon warm water and at least ⅛ teaspoon salt to\\nmake a thick, concentrated solution. Put 3 to 5 drops of this salt water in each nostril.\\nThis greatly helps to drain and unclog the sinuses and relieve the headache.\\nT\\nIME TO\\n S\\nEE THE\\n D\\nOCTOR\\nGenerally headaches can be relieved using Ayurvedic remedies. However, if\\nyou have a headache that persists for more than a couple of days; if your\\nheadache is accompanied by a fever or stiʃ neck; if you also experience\\nneurological symptoms such as blurred vision, diɽculty with coordination or\\nspeech, memory loss, numbness, or weakness in your arms or legs; if you wake\\nup at midnight with a headache; or if you are having headaches often that seem\\nto be becoming more severe, then please see a doctor.\\nYOGA POSTURES FOR HEADACHES\\nGenerally, a person having headaches should do the Moon Salutation. Certain yoga\\npostures are also helpful, such as the Boat pose, Hidden Lotus, Bow pose, Spinal Twist,\\nPalm Tree pose, and Standing on the Toes. (For illustrations of yoga poses see \\nappendix\\n4\\n.) Inverted poses such as Headstand, Shoulder Stand, and the Plow pose are not\\nrecommended.\\n \\nHearing Loss\\n \\nHearing is governed by an aspect of vata known as \\nprana\\n vata. In older people,\\nprana\\n vata tends to get debilitated, leading to what is known as conductive or nerve\\ndeafness: The person doesn’t hear properly because the nerves become weak.\\nTo improve hearing, try the following natural remedies:\\nTAKE YOGARAJ \\nGUGGULU\\n.

Make fresh ginger tea by boiling a\\nlittle grated or sliced ginger in a cup or two of water. Or grate a little ginger and add it\\nto \\nyour rice and/or your soup. Eating a little bit of ginger every day will help to prevent\\nheart attack.\\n• The following formula of four Ayurvedic herbs is good for the heart:\\npunarnava 4 parts\\nkutki 3 parts\\ngulwel sattva ¼ part\\nshilajit ¼ part\\nSteep ½ teaspoon of this herb mixture in a cup of hot water to make a tea.\\nDrinking that tea twice a day after lunch and dinner will help your heart.\\n• Another simple domestic remedy to protect the heart and keep it healthy is to\\ninclude a little garlic in your diet. Garlic reduces cholesterol, strengthens the circulation,\\nand acts as a decongestant.\\nRUDRAKSHA\\n. Rudraksha\\n, the “tears of Shiva,” are the dried seeds from the fruit of the\\nrudraksha\\n tree. An ancient story says that when Lord Shiva came out of deep meditation,\\na few tears dropped from his eyes and fell to earth, from which sprang up the \\nrudraksha\\ntree. The seeds are good for the heart both physically and spiritually; they are said to be\\ngood for meditation and for “opening the heart chakra.”\\nYou can wear a necklace of the beads externally, in front of the heart.

If you ɹnd it diɽcult to do this, take a paper bag, open it, hold the\\nedges near your nose, and breathe into the bag (both exhaling and then inhaling).

This frequently happens in\\nold age. Somewhere around 65, the walls of the blood vessels often become thicker and\\nthe passage becomes narrower, with the result that many individuals develop a type of\\nhypertension known as essential hypertension. It is a vata condition and is diʃerent\\nfrom the narrowing of the arteries that occurs as a result of fatty deposits on the artery\\nwalls, which is a kapha condition.\\nPitta is responsible for the rushing of the blood with more force. Kapha is related to\\nincreased blood viscosity.\\nPhysical and emotional stress, including anger and anxiety, constrict the blood\\nvessels and can increase blood pressure for a time. Heavy responsibilities, or stressful\\nsituations such as public speaking, may send your blood pressure soaring.

Entirely natural means, such as diet, exercise, herbs, meditation,\\nand yoga, which have no negative side eʃects, may be quite suɽcient to deal\\nwith hypertension.\\nHowever, high blood pressure does require a doctor’s supervision.\\nHypertension is a potentially life-threatening condition. I do not recommend\\nthat you use the following treatments in place of standard medical care.\\nRather, try these Ayurvedic remedies—preferably with your doctor’s\\nknowledge and approval—as an adjunct to your medical care, and ask your\\ndoctor to monitor your progress. If the remedies are successful, he or she will\\nɹnd less and less need to supervise your condition and keep you on medications.\\nAt the least you should be able to gradually reduce the dosage of your medicines.\\nFOODS FOR HYPERTENSION\\nSeveral foods can help you control hypertension:\\n• Drink 1 cup mango juice, followed about an hour later by ½ cup warm milk, with a\\npinch of cardamom, a pinch of nutmeg, and 1 teaspoon ghee. (\\nNote:\\n If your cholesterol\\nlevel is high, skip the ghee.)\\n• Mix orange juice and coconut water (the natural juice inside a fresh coconut) in a\\nratio of 2 parts orange to 1 part coconut. Drink ½ to 1 cup 2 or 3 times a day.\\n• Add 1 teaspoon coriander and 1 pinch cardamom to 1 cup freshly squeezed (not\\ncanned) peach juice. Drink this as many as 2 or 3 times a day to help with high blood\\npressure.\\n• Eat some watermelon with a pinch of cardamom and a pinch of coriander added.\\nThis will act as a mild diuretic and will help to regulate blood pressure.\\n• Try some cucumber raita with your meal. Cucumber is a good diuretic. Raita is a\\nyogurt-based condiment often used in Indian cooking. (See the recipe in the\\naccompanying sidebar.)\\n• Mung dal soup, made of mung dal with cilantro, cumin, and a pinch of turmeric, is\\ngood for persons with hypertension.\\n• Honey water can also help.

Working hard under the hot sun should be avoided by anyone with high\\nblood pressure, as that may promote hemorrhage in the brain. Be cautious about this.\\nMAGNETIC WATER\\n. You may be able to keep your blood pressure under control by drinking\\nmagnetic water. Put a cupful of water (preferably in a glass container) next to the north\\npole of a magnet. Let it sit for 2 hours.

This is beneficial for regulating blood pressure.\\nDeep Relaxation to Help High Blood Pressure\\nTension and stress increase high blood pressure. A wonderful and eʃective way\\nto relax is the yogic rest pose, \\nsavasana\\n.\\nLie quietly, ɻat on your back with arms by your sides. Observe the ɻow of your\\nbreath. You will notice that after exhalation there is a brief, natural stop, and\\nanother natural pause after inhalation and before the next exhalation. In that stop,\\nstay naturally quiet for just a few seconds. This practice will bring you deep\\nrelaxation, a natural antidote for hypertension. Remain in \\nsavasana\\n practicing this\\nquiet breathing for 10 to 15 minutes.\\nMEDITATION\\n. Meditation is excellent for regulating blood pressure. (See \\nchapter 7\\n for\\nguidelines to help you meditate.)

If you are late to eat at\\nyour regular mealtime and you feel light-headed or dizzy while standing up, or\\nexperience palpitations, tremor, nausea, drowsiness, sweating, nervousness, or mental\\nconfusion, all these indicate hypoglycemia. In some serious cases of hypoglycemia, a\\nperson can even have convulsions and fall into coma.\\nThe brain uses blood sugar (glucose) as its sole food, and it depends on it for the\\nnecessary energy for its activity. If the brain doesn’t receive suɽcient blood sugar, it\\ngoes into crisis; it will create tremors, headache, sweating, nausea, drowsiness, and the\\nother symptoms mentioned because it is starving for blood sugar.\\nAccording to Ayurveda, hypoglycemia is common in persons with pitta \\nprakruti\\n (a\\npitta constitution) or pitta \\nvikruti\\n (a present pitta imbalance). Increased pitta stimulates\\nthe secretion of insulin, which lowers the blood sugar level and creates hypoglycemia.\\nHypoglycemia in turn induces the secretion of adrenaline, which causes rapid heartbeat\\nand tremors.\\nAn unduly large dose of insulin taken by a diabetic person may lead to\\nhypoglycemia. This condition is also common among alcoholics.\\nHypoglycemia is a disorder that needs careful attention. To maintain their blood\\nsugar level, pitta individuals should eat regular meals—breakfast, lunch, and dinner—\\nand also have some fruit or another snack between meals or whenever they feel\\nhypoglycemic \\nsymptoms. Emphasize proteins and complex carbohydrates for main\\nmeals; they digest more slowly, so the rises and falls in blood sugar will be less rapid.\\nT\\nIME TO\\n S\\nEE THE\\n D\\nOCTOR'),\n",

When a middle-\\naged person craves sugar about 90 minutes after a full meal, it may mean that\\nhe or she has, or is going to develop, a pancreatic tumor. This is a serious health\\nconcern and requires medical attention.\\nHypoglycemia can be classiɹed into two types: fasting and reactive. Fasting\\nhypoglycemia simply results from not eating, which is why people with a tendency\\ntoward low blood sugar need to eat regular meals. In addition, some individuals choose\\nto fast, whether for religious reasons or for cleansing purposes. If they do too much\\nprolonged fasting, hypoglycemia may result.\\nReactive hypoglycemia occurs when the pancreas, often in response to a large intake\\nof sugar, secretes too much insulin, which then reduces the blood sugar level. This is also\\ncalled postprandial (after-eating) hypoglycemia. About 90 minutes after eating, the\\nblood sugar level drops, and the person craves something sweet.\\nTo deal with reactive hypoglycemia, one should treat pitta dosha.\\nDIET\\n. Follow the pitta-pacifying diet (outlined in \\nchapter 8\\n). Stay away from hot spicy\\nfoods, fermented food, sour and citrus fruits, and alcoholic drinks. Smoking cigarettes\\nshould be curtailed or eliminated, as cigarettes also aggravate pitta.\\nLICORICE TEA\\n. Drink licorice tea. When you are feeling lightheaded or faint or have some\\nother hypoglycemic symptoms, make a cup of licorice (\\nyashti madhu\\n) tea, using 1\\nteaspoon of licorice root per cup of water. This tea will safely increase your blood sugar\\nlevel.

Many people think it is always an emotional or psychological issue, but\\nit can also be due to stress or to certain physical problems.\\nFor example, when a person has high cholesterol, the fat and plaque may get\\ndeposited on the coronary arteries, blocking the ɻow of blood to the heart and\\ntriggering a heart attack due to the insuɽcient blood supply. Similarly, the plaque may\\nget deposited in the blood vessels leading to the penis, resulting in a “penis attack”—in\\nwhich the blood supply to the penis is insuɽcient to create or sustain an erection,\\nresulting in impotence.\\nMASSAGE TO IMPROVE CIRCULATION\\n. A simple and eʃective remedy is to massage the pubic area\\n(the lower part of your abdomen) and the root of the penis with a few drops of\\nmahanarayan\\n oil.

Here are\\nseveral suggestions:\\nGINGER\\n. One of the best herbs to kindle agni is ginger. Before each meal, chop or grate\\na little fresh ginger, add a few drops of lime juice and a pinch of salt, and chew it up.\\nAlternatively, you can simply cut a thin slice of ginger, put on a pinch of salt, and chew\\nthat.\\nGARLIC AND \\nTRIKATU\\n.

Enliven your gastric ɹre with the common spice bay leaf. Steep ½ teaspoon\\ncrushed or ground-up bay leaf in a cup of hot water for about 10 minutes to make a tea.\\nAdd a pinch of cardamom, and drink after eating.\\nFASTING\\nFasting can be beneɹcial to dispel indigestion. Fasting not only kindles the digestive\\nɹre, it also gives the digestive system a rest. When you have indigestion, you can either\\nobserve a complete fast, or try this: Drink 1 cup of sweet fresh pineapple juice with a\\npinch of ginger, a pinch of black pepper, and ½ teaspoon organic sugar. Take this 3\\ntimes a day.\\nWHEN YOU HAVE INDIGESTION'),\n",

Emotional eating can affect the digestive fire adversely.\\n• Eat only two or at most three meals a day: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Avoid\\nsnacking between meals.\\n• Avoid cold and iced drinks, especially during or after meals. They cool the digestive\\nfire. For best digestion, take small sips of warm water during a meal.\\n• Fill your stomach to one-third of its capacity with food and one-third with liquid,\\nleaving one-third empty. This aids in proper digestion and promotes mental clarity.\\n• Chew your food well to make sure the saliva is well mixed in. Saliva plays a major\\nrole in digestion.\\n• You can ɹnish your meal by drinking a cup of lassi. This is made by blending 4\\nteaspoons of yogurt with 2 pinches each of ginger and cumin powder in 1 cup of water.\\n• Yoga postures that can be helpful for improving digestion include Leg Lifts and the\\nPeacock pose.

An individual with an underactive thyroid or parathyroid gland can develop\\ncalcium stones.\\n• Phosphate stones are rough; they irritate the bladder and cause pain because of\\ntheir rough quality. They are primarily caused by increased phosphates in the system,\\ndue to excess eating of nightshade plants (potatoes, eggplant, tomatoes).\\n• Oxalate stones are sharp. They are pitta stones. They irritate, burn, and create\\nbleeding, and they may create a great deal of pain from loin to groin. A diet high in\\noxalic acid promotes formation of pitta stones. Thus individuals who eat spinach,\\npotato, tomato, and rhubarb, which are rich in oxalic acid, have a tendency to form\\nstones. These food items should be strictly avoided by anyone concerned about\\npreventing the formation of kidney stones.\\nHERBAL REMEDIES\\n.

Another way to ease the pain of passing a kidney stone is to\\nalternate hot and cold applications to the kidney area.

Soak 10 raw (unroasted) almonds overnight, and next morning peel oʃ\\nthe skin and eat them. In addition to providing a high-quality protein, almonds are a\\ngood source of calcium. Pregnant mothers need both. And they settle the stomach.\\nWALK IT OFF\\n. Sometimes walking in the fresh morning air helps with morning sickness,\\nbecause fresh cool air reduces pitta. It also helps to relieve stress. It sometimes happens\\nthat a pitta woman, working for a demanding boss and coming home to a criticizing\\nhusband, develops some unresolved anger. Stress builds up in the solar plexus and\\nmanifests as morning sickness. It is important for her to reduce her stress level by doing\\nsome early morning walking or other appropriate exercise.'),\n",

In the morning, before taking a shower, warm up 3 to 5 ounces of sesame\\noil (for vata constitutions), coconut oil (for pittas) or sunɻower oil (for kaphas), and rub\\nit over your body for 5 to 10 minutes. Be sure to get some on your scalp and feet. Then\\ntake a nice warm shower. This soothing oil massage (called \\nabhyanga\\n) will minimize\\nstress and help with morning sickness.\\nMILK WITH ROSE WATER\\n. Buy some rose essence or rose water. When you are feeling\\nnauseated, put 1 drop in a cupful of milk, boil the milk, and then drink it warm. (You\\ncan just as well use 5 fresh rose petals from your garden to boil in the milk.) This will\\nhelp to eliminate the nausea. As a preventive measure, taking a cup of this rose milk\\nwith a teaspoon of ghee at bedtime will pacify pitta and help to control morning\\nsickness.\\nDRINK A LOT\\n. Vomiting can lead to dehydration, so you need to drink extra liquid to\\ncompensate. Better still, make some homemade dextrosaline by adding 2 teaspoons\\nsugar, the juice of ½ lime, and a pinch of salt to 1 pint of water. Drink 1 cup every 2\\nhours to eliminate dehydration and help the nausea and vomiting subside.\\nPEACOCK FEATHER ASH\\n. This remedy might sound strange, but it is quite eʃective. Ayurvedic\\nliterature says that morning sickness can be remedied by using peacock feather ash.\\nBurn a peacock feather in such a way that you can collect the ash. The smell of the\\nburning feather is quite awful, so someone else should burn the feather, not the\\npregnant woman. Take just a pinch of the powdery ash with a teaspoon of honey.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies.pdf', 'page': 247}, page_content='Muscle cramps and spasms have numerous causes. They may be due to insuɽcient\\nblood supply to the muscle or, in some cases, to excess blood supply, as in the case of\\n“writer’s cramp.” Muscle spasms can be due to lack of calcium in the diet or\\nmalabsorption of calcium, since calcium plays a significant role in relaxing the muscle. A\\nrelated problem is hypoparathyroidism (underactive parathyroid), in which the person\\nloses calcium; this may also cause the muscles to undergo spasm. Exposure to cold and\\npoor circulation may also be responsible.\\nThe Ayurvedic understanding is, in simplest terms, that muscle spasms are caused by\\nvata dosha. Vata, increased by mobile, cold, or rough qualities, makes a muscle stiʃ and\\nhard, and it undergoes spasm.\\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELIEF\\n. Whenever a muscle is under spasm\\n• Grab hold of it.\\n• At the same time, press your index ɹnger deeply into the “belly” of the muscle (the\\nbulging central part of the muscle) for 15 to 20 seconds. A \\nmarma\\n point (like an\\nacupressure point) is located in the center of the muscle; pressing on it helps the muscle\\nrelax.\\n• Take a few deep breaths.\\nThis procedure will increase circulation, and the muscle will relax.\\nANOTHER PRESSURE POINT REMEDY\\n. A \\nmarma\\n point is located at the midpoint of both the lips. If\\nthere is a spasm in the upper body, such as in the arms or ɹngers, grab hold of your\\nupper lip, in the middle, between your thumb and index ɹnger. If the spasm is in the\\nlegs or the lower part of the body, grab the lower lip.\\nThese energy points on the lips send messages to the brain, which in turn relays a\\nsignal to the motor system to relax the muscles. Just grabbing the lips for 30 seconds\\nshould help relieve the spasm. Press fairly strongly, but not hard enough to be painful.\\nCONTRACT AND RELAX THE MUSCLE\\n. Repeatedly alternate contraction and relaxation of the\\nmuscle. This will improve circulation and help to release lactic acid, which will relax the\\nmuscle.\\nMASSAGE\\n. Another approach is to apply a little oil to the muscle belly and gently\\nmassage. \\nMahanarayan\\n oil is best if you have it; otherwise, some sesame oil or other oil\\nwill do. Gentle massage of the painful cramped muscle will relax the muscle ɹbers,\\nimprove the circulation, and pacify the vata. That will help relieve the spasm.\\nAfter rubbing in the \\nmahanarayan\\n oil, apply a little heat. For best results, use a hot\\nwater bottle (not an electric heating pad).\\nWinter, with its dry, cold weather, is vata season. During winter season, when vata\\nindividuals get exposed to the cold, their muscles may cramp. Rubbing the muscle with\\nmahanarayan\\n oil (or sesame oil) and hen applying heat will be soothing and healing.'),\n",

Make yourself a cup of chamomile tea, \\njatamamsi\\n tea, or comfrey tea.\\nOr, even better, you can make a tea using equal amounts of all three of these herbs (⅓\\nteaspoon of each per cup). It will help to relax your muscles.\\nFOR PREVENTION\\n. As a preventive measure against future cramping, drink some\\ndashamoola\\n tea—½ teaspoon of \\ndashamoola\\n powder steeped for a few minutes in 1 cup\\nhot water. Have a cup or two of \\ndashamoola\\n tea every Saturday.\\nMINERAL SUPPLEMENTS\\n. Getting repeated muscle cramps suggests that you either have a\\ncalcium deɹciency or are not absorbing enough of the calcium in your food. First, take\\nsome supplements of calcium, magnesium, and zinc. Your formula should contain\\napproximately 1,200 mg. calcium, 600 mg. magnesium, and 60 mg. zinc. Take these\\nsupplements at bedtime.\\nSecond, to improve absorption, take \\ntriphala\\n every night or in the very early\\nmorning.

Muscle cramps and cramps in the stomach may\\nbe related. Muscle pain can happen anywhere in the body, in the skeletal muscles as\\nwell as in the smooth muscles of the abdomen. As with spasm in the arm or leg,\\nabdominal cramps may have many causes, such as eating too big a meal, or lifting too\\nheavy a weight, which strains the abdominal muscles. Gases in the stomach,\\nconstipation, or acid indigestion can also create cramps in the stomach or abdomen.\\n• For painful cramps in the abdominal muscles, take the herbal compound \\nshankavati\\n(one 200-mg. tablet after dinner).\\n• This antacid formula may also be effective:\\nshatavari ½ teaspoon\\nguduchi ¼ teaspoon\\nshanka bhasma pinch\\nTake this entire amount once or twice a day, after meals.\\n• Warm milk is helpful for abdominal muscle cramps.

As a result, they may\\ndevelop rhinitis, with nasal congestion and nasal discharge. Even in the absence of\\ninfection, dryness in the atmosphere may dry up the mucous membranes and nasal\\npassage; to compensate for that, the body will produce more mucus. Then, due to\\ncontinuing dry heat in the environment, the nasal discharge becomes thick, dry, and\\ncrusty. This is known as nasal crust.\\nPeople with deviated nasal septum can also accumulate nasal discharge, and because\\nof dryness in the air it may form a crust. Nasal crust can create stuʃy nose, sinus\\nheadache, and diɽculty breathing. It can be one of the causes of snoring and of sleep\\napnea. Nosebleeds may also be due to nasal crust.\\nAyurvedic medicine offers a number of effective remedies:\\nSTEAM IT\\n. The simplest remedy is to inhale steam. You can use plain water, water with\\nsome ginger boiled in it, or a tea of the following ingredients:\\nginger\\najwan (Indian celery seed)\\nturmeric\\nPut equal amounts of each of these herbs in a pint of water, and boil it up.\\nThen turn oʃ the ɹre, put a towel over your head, and inhale the steam. This\\nwill ease out the discharge. The crust will come out, and you will breathe freely.\\nThough simple, this is an effective remedy.\\nMENTHOL AND EUCALYPTUS\\n.

Chop up an onion, and sniʃ its fragrance. Onions contain ammonia,\\nwhich is a powerful decongestant. It brings tears to the eyes and promotes sneezing. The\\ntears from the eyes will pass through the tear ducts and into the nasal passage, which\\nwill lubricate and loosen the crust; then the sneezing will help the crust to be eliminated.\\nLUBRICATE THE NOSTRILS\\n.

Whenever there is cerebral hypoxia—\\nlack of oxygen and \\nprana\\n to the brain—the person can get nightmares. This can occur\\neven due to insufficient fresh air in the room.\\nTREATING NIGHTMARES IN CHILDREN\\nThe main cause of nightmares in children is psychological—fear and anxiety based\\non frightening images they have seen or scary stories they have heard. So it is important\\nnot to feed the child’s imagination with disturbing images. Keep children busy with\\ncreative play; don’t let them watch violent or horrifying television programs or read\\nfrightening stories.\\nThe child’s room should be pleasant and ɹlled with sweetness, with nice music and\\nperhaps some tinkling bells. Bells have a happy sound that children like.

Rub some oil, especially \\nbrahmi\\n oil or\\nbhringaraj\\n oil, on the soles of the feet and on the scalp. This will help relax the child.

Vata dreams are active and hyper. They are plentiful, and the\\ndreamer may well forget them in the morning. Horror, fear, running, jumping,\\nɻying high in the sky, falling deep down into a valley, being attacked or pursued,\\nbeing locked up—these are vata dreams.\\n• Pitta dreams. These dreams can be rather violent. In addition to such themes as\\nteaching, studying, trying to solve a problem, or failing at an examination, pitta\\ndreams may involve fire, war, nuclear weapons, fighting, killing, and murder.\\n• Kapha dreams. Kapha dreams are generally mild and romantic. Water ɹgures\\nprominently, such as swimming in the ocean. Seeing gardens, lotus ɻowers, swans,\\nand elephants and eating candy are all characteristic of kapha dreams. Drowning,\\nor seeing oneself as dead, are “negative” aspects of the kapha dream repertory.\\nEAT EARLY\\n. Eat dinner before seven o’clock.

Trauma to the nose, extreme dryness of the\\nnasal passage so that the nasal mucous membranes crack and bleed, allergies, rhinitis, a\\nnasal polyp, or high blood pressure may all cause nosebleed. Going to a high altitude or\\nconsuming excess alcohol are also possible causes.\\nUsually we don’t have any time to investigate the cause; we need to treat it\\nimmediately. Here are several effective remedies:\\nDRINK COOL WATER\\n. This alone will stop many nosebleeds.\\nUSE A COLD COMPRESS\\n. Dip a handkerchief or any clean soft cloth into cold water, and place\\nit on the forehead and the nose. Then \\ngently\\n blow the nose so that the clot, if there is\\none, comes out. (If there is a dry nasal crust, it will irritate the nasal passage and cause\\nbleeding.)\\nSNIFF COLD WATER\\n. Take a little cool water in your palm, inhale it up into the nose, and\\ngently blow the nose.\\nSQUEEZE YOUR NOSE\\n. If the cold water doesn’t stop the bleeding, then pinch the nose with\\nyour thumb and index ɹnger, as if you were about to dip under water. Hold for 2 or 3\\nminutes, breathing normally through the mouth. That should stop the bleeding.\\nGHEE OINTMENT\\n. If the bleeding still doesn’t stop, another simple remedy is to put a\\ncouple of drops of lukewarm ghee in each nostril. Dip a cotton swab into a jar of ghee,\\nand apply it to the nose. Ghee is hemostatic—that is, it stops bleeding.\\nSTAND OR SIT UPRIGHT\\n. Don’t lie down, which will encourage bleeding. Also don’t do any\\ninverted yoga postures such as Headstand, \\nShoulder Stand or Plow. Remaining upright\\nwill minimize bleeding.\\nHUMIDIFY YOUR SURROUNDINGS\\n. Many nosebleeds are due to a dry nose, caused by hot, dry\\nair. So as a preventive measure in dry climates or in winter when heating the house can\\ncreate a lot of dry air, be sure to humidify your bedroom, workroom, or the entire living\\nspace. It is better not to use an ultrasound humidifier; a hot water unit is best.\\nHERBAL REMEDY\\n. Orally, take a mixture of:\\nmanjistha ⅓ teaspoon\\nkama dudha ⅛ teaspoon\\nTake this mixture with a little warm water twice a day.\\nJUICE CURE\\n.

You may have a\\nserious health problem. The bleeding may be due to high blood pressure, which\\nneeds to be cared for. Or it could possibly be caused by leukemia, a type of blood\\ncancer.\\nFOLLOW THE PITTA-PACIFYING DIET\\n. According to Ayurvedic principles, even though nosebleed\\nhas some vata symptoms, such as dryness and cracking of the nasal passages, it is\\nessentially a pitta disorder, in which pitta becomes hot and sharp and causes the\\nbleeding. So when you have a nosebleed, don’t eat hot and spicy foods, abstain from\\nalcohol and cigarettes, and don’t work under the hot sun. These are all pitta-provoking.\\n \\nObesity\\n \\nObesity is a condition in which an individual is signiɹcantly overweight, and an\\nexcessive amount of body fat has accumulated under the chin and on the breasts, belly,\\nbuttocks, and/or thighs. Though it is not a serious disease in itself, it may shorten the\\nspan of life, as well as create diminished eɽciency and a predisposition to diabetes,\\nhypertension, low libido, and arthritis. Ultimately, obesity reduces happiness.\\nTo a great extent, obesity is due to the socioeconomic problems of an aʀuent\\nsociety. A prosperous life, a sedentary job, and lack of exercise are the major\\ncontributors to obesity.

Certain hereditary factors of the\\nendocrine system, such as excess production of growth hormone, may contribute to the\\ncondition. When women are pregnant, they may eat too much and be unable to lose the\\nweight afterward. Stress may induce repeated emotional eating, leading to signiɹcant\\nweight gain.

Avoid habitually drinking cold drinks\\nand eating fatty fried foods. Minimize dairy products such as cheese, yogurt, and ice\\ncream. Be sure to include salad (without creamy dressings) and beans in your meals.\\nDrink hot water instead of ice-cold drinks.

Do some regular exercise. A daily walk of at least half an hour is\\nessential. And do some aerobic exercise, such as gentle jogging.

When you\\ntake in more calories than you burn oʃ, you will gain weight. In order to lose weight,\\nyou \\nmust\\n burn oʃ more calories than you take in. In practical terms, this means two\\nthings: reducing your caloric intake, and increasing your output in the form of exercise.\\nFollow the kapha-reducing diet, and increase the amount of exercise you do every day.\\nYOUR POSTEXERCISE PRESCRIPTION\\n. Immediately after exercise, kapha individuals will feel\\nhungry and thirsty and will want to rush to the restaurant to have a cold drink and a\\nbite to eat. But the cold drink will slow down the metabolism, defeating the gain from\\nthe exercise. And we know that the eating will be counterproductive. So after exercise\\nheavy and obese people should skip snacks and stay away from cold water and other\\ncold drinks, and choose hot drinks such as herbal teas.\\nEAT YOUR BIGGEST MEAL EARLY IN THE DAY\\n. According to Ayurveda, the best policy regarding\\nmeals, if you are overweight, is to skip breakfast entirely (maybe have some hot herbal\\ntea), then take your biggest meal at noon. Supper should be light. Don’t snack between\\nthe two meals.\\nIf you can’t seem to skip breakfast, take your main meal then, early in the day.

This is signiɹcant\\nbecause there is a deep relationship between food and love. Food is the food of the body;\\nlove is the food of the soul. When an individual is missing love in a relationship, he or\\nshe may try to ɹnd love through eating, and food will become a substitute for love.\\nWhen a woman misses her husband or a man misses his wife, they frequently begin to\\neat too much.\\nT\\nIME TO\\n S\\nEE THE\\n D\\nOCTOR\\nIf you are very heavy and have not exercised for a long time, and especially\\nif you are over 40, you \\nmust\\n see your doctor before you start an exercise\\nprogram more strenuous than walking.\\nObese people also hate how they look, and they hate looking in the mirror because\\nthey don’t like what they see. When people hate their body, they become anxious and\\nworried; then suddenly they become hungry and need to eat. This is not real hunger; it is\\nfalse, emotional hunger. (See “\\nEating Disorders\\n” and “\\nOvereating\\n” for further discussion\\nof emotional eating.)\\nTo help develop more love for yourself just as you are, try this technique. Go into\\nyour bathroom and remove all your clothes, or wear some shorts. Then take a good look\\nat the person you see in the full-length mirror. Look at that image, starting at the head,\\nthe eyes, cheeks, lips, and neck; look at your chest, your belly, and so on.\\nAs you look at the image in your mirror, at the same time look within. Ask yourself,\\ndo you like those eyes of yours? Do you love your nose? Don’t you have some aʃection\\ntoward your own lips, your own chest?\\nIn this way, gradually, by looking outside, into the mirror, and at the same time\\ninside at your own inner observer, two things will happen. First, you will begin to feel\\nthat you are beyond your body, that you are something higher, nobler, greater, and\\nmore beautiful, that you are pure existence. Second, this process will also bring greater\\nacceptance, and you will start feeling more love for yourself. So look at yourself in the\\nmirror, and love that person that you see.\\nA second important factor in loving yourself \\nis to stop judging, comparing, and\\ncriticizing yourself.

Also, while sitting on the ɻoor, bend forward as far as you\\ncomfortably can, with the goal of eventually touching your head to your knees. (You’ll\\nhave to work up to this one gradually.)

Sometimes the individual loses so much\\nbone that weak spots develop in the skeletal structure. Then the hips, forearms, or even\\nthe spine can fracture quite easily. The bones may crack under the body’s own weight,\\nor a minor injury may be enough to create a fracture.\\nOsteoporosis is more common in women than men. Women lose bone rapidly after\\nmenopause. This is because the postmenopausal body produces little or no estrogen,\\nwhich is necessary for maintaining bone metabolism utilizing calcium, magnesium, zinc,\\nand other materials for building the bone. So it is during the postmenopausal years that\\nwomen may have a tendency toward osteoporosis.\\nMen also need estrogen to maintain strong bones, but testosterone and prostatic\\nsecretions also play an important role. However, men may lose bone mass due to heavy\\ndrinking, heavy smoking, chewing tobacco, and taking steroids.\\nLack of exercise can also reduce bone mass. To some extent, people need some stress\\nto the body, in the form of exercise. Research has shown that if a person is conɹned to\\nbed for several weeks, the bones become signiɹcantly weaker. Once the ill eʃects of lack\\nof exercise became clear, exercise programs were designed even for astronauts in space.\\nExercise is a food for the bones.\\nFor women, the combination of increased vata simply from growing older (see\\nchapter 2\\n, where we talk about the stages of life), plus the menopausal cessation of\\nestrogen, may have a powerfully deleterious effect on bone mass.\\nEXERCISE\\n. Gentle, daily exercise for 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week, can help to treat\\nosteoporosis. Walking is excellent and quite sufficient, but you may do swimming, gentle\\njogging, or whatever suits your constitution and level of ɹtness, and the condition of\\nyour bones.\\nSome people recommend weight-bearing exercise, even including weight lifting, for\\nbuilding bone. While this is good in general, for a person with osteoporosis it can be\\nquite dangerous; as mentioned above, even a slight injury may crack the fragile bones of\\na person with osteoporosis. Therefore a good, \\nsafe way to begin an exercise program is\\nto do some underwater exercise. As the bones become stronger, weight-bearing exercise,'),\n",

Your daily dose\\nshould include about 1,200 mg. calcium, along with 600 mg. magnesium and 60 mg. zinc\\nfor maximum absorption and effectiveness.\\nAlmond milk also contains a signiɹcant amount of calcium.

Statistically,\\novereating happens more in women than in men.\\nFrom an Ayurvedic perspective, due to emotional factors and stress, \\nprana\\n vata\\nstimulates \\njatharagni\\n, the gastric ɹre, and this stimulation activates the stomach.

Do about 10 repetitions of the Ashwini Mudra. This way you train your\\norgan to be ready but not to ejaculate. To succeed at this, you have to practice with\\ngreat care.\\nDo this exercise about 1 to 2 hours before making love.\\nIMPORTANT\\n: This is not masturbation, nor an endorsement of masturbation.\\n• You can also learn to control ejaculation by contracting the muscles of the buttocks.\\n• Locate the \\nmarma\\n point (an energy center like an acupressure point) at the center\\nof the glans penis, on the underside. Gently press that point, and at the same time suck\\nthe anus inward and hold for ɹve seconds. Release. Do this 10 times.

These include hemorrhoids;\\ninɻammation of the rectal area due to aggravated pitta; anal ɹssures or polyps; passing\\ndry, hard stools, which hurt the mucous membrane of the rectum; straining due to\\nconstipation; excessive pressure on the rectal veins due to liver cirrhosis; and congestive\\nheart failure. In the last stage of pregnancy, prolonged pushing of the child during labor\\nexerts pressure on the rectal blood vessels and leads to bleeding. Rectal bleeding is also\\ncommon among people who eat reɹned foods containing little ɹber. Eating hot spicy\\nfood may tend to produce constipation and rectal bleeding.\\nWhatever the cause, the following recommendations will be helpful.\\nWASH WITH COOL WATER\\n. After each bowel movement, wash the anal oriɹce with cool water.\\nThis will help stop the bleeding, and if there is irritation, itching, and cracking, it will\\nhelp to minimize it.\\nAPPLY GHEE OR CASTOR OIL\\n.

Also avoid fermented\\nfood, sour fruit, citrus fruit, and alcohol.\\nKEEP THE STOOLS SOFT\\n. This will help to minimize irritation and bleeding. Here are three\\nways to keep stools soft:\\n• Drink a cup of warm milk with 1 teaspoon plain ghee at bedtime.

This\\nbulk laxative will keep the stools soft and avoid pressure on the rectal blood vessels.\\nUSE VITAMIN K\\n. If the bleeding is serious (that is, profuse or repeated), take vitamin K\\nsupplements according to the dosage recommended on the package. Also, you can buy\\nvitamin K cream at most health food stores. Apply this cream to the anal oriɹce to stop\\nthe bleeding.\\nPACIFY PITTA\\n.

There are ten\\nsinus cavities, ɹve on each side, all connected to the nose. They are covered with a\\nsuperɹne mucous membrane.

Daily oil massage over your whole body is very eʃective for keeping your\\nskin healthy and beautiful. If you are vata or have a vata imbalance, use sesame oil. If\\nyou are pitta or have a pitta imbalance, use sunɻower oil. If you are kapha or have a\\nkapha imbalance, use corn oil or canola oil. Gentle oil massage maintains the beauty\\nand texture of the skin.\\nTAKE TURMERIC\\n. To have beautiful skin, take a capsule of turmeric daily. Ayurvedic\\ntradition states that if a pregnant woman takes turmeric regularly, her child will have\\ngorgeous skin!\\nGET ENOUGH IRON IN YOUR DIET\\n. If your skin looks pale, it may be a sign of anemia. Drink\\nsome carrot juice, and eat cooked beets. This will give you natural iron and should\\nimprove skin color. (See further suggestions under “\\nAnemia\\n.”)\\nSOAK UP SOME SUN\\n. Apply the appropriate doshic oil to your skin (sesame for vata\\nconstitutions, coconut or sunɻower for pitta, corn for kapha), and lie in the sun for a\\nlittle while—10 to 15 minutes, or at the most half an hour. This will improve the\\ncirculation and strengthen skin tone.\\nNOTE\\n: Sunbathing should be done either before noon or in the late afternoon\\n(after three o’clock), when the rays are not as direct. Also, the danger of sunburn\\nis greater at high altitudes, so take care to limit your exposure when you’re in\\nthe mountains.\\nUSE HERBALIZED OILS\\n.

As a general rule, it is beneɹcial to use soap on your skin only once\\nor twice a week, not on a regular everyday basis. In a tropical climate, where people\\nsweat a lot and their sweat contains salts and minerals that lodge in the skin, they have\\nto take a soap bath every day. But in colder countries, where there is not much\\nsweating, so much soap bathing is usually not necessary.\\nOf course, it depends on a person’s job. Someone who does hard physical work and\\nsweats a lot needs some kind of soap. But to maintain softness and luster, it’s important\\nnot to wash oʃ the sebaceous secretions that maintain the oiliness of the skin. If we\\napply soap daily, the oil will be washed off and the skin will become dry.\\nPitta constitutional types may need soap a little more often, perhaps three times a\\nweek, both because they tend to perspire more and because pitta skin tends to be more\\noily.\\nMATCH WATER TEMPERATURE TO YOUR CONSTITUTION\\n. Generally, washing in cool water is\\nrecommended for pitta, warm water for kapha, and hot water for vata. Vata individuals\\noften have poor circulation, and hot water will improve circulation and help to keep\\nskin healthy and beautiful.\\nGENTLE TOWEL MASSAGE\\n.

It may also happen at\\nhigh altitudes. Sleep apnea is often accompanied by loud snoring and an abnormal\\nbreathing pattern.\\nApnea in older children and adults is less life-threatening. But because the person’s\\nsleep is brieɻy interrupted each time the breathing stops, sometimes dozens of times in a\\nnight, it can be physically exhausting. It strains the cardiovascular system and\\nrespiratory system and may create excess carbon dioxide in the blood. It may lead to\\ndrowsiness and irritability during the wakeful state and an inability to concentrate, due\\nto insufficient sleep.\\nIn Ayurvedic terms, sleep apnea occurs because \\ntarpaka\\n kapha is blocking \\nprana\\n vata.\\nSo treatment centers on controlling excess kapha.\\nTO CONTROL KAPHA\\n.

Exercise,\\nincluding \\nyoga asanas\\n, is not recommended.\\n \\nStress\\n \\nStress is a psychosomatic disorder that has many causes in our day-to-day life. We\\nmay \\nget stressed when traɽc is jammed, when we have to stand in a long line, or when\\nwe deal with a diɽcult work situation. An all-too-common cause of stress is the feeling\\nthat we have too much to do and too little time to do it. Unemployment is another\\npotential source, as are pollution and crime. Even watching crime stories day after day\\non television builds up stress. An unhappy relationship, a dominating spouse, faulty\\nplumbing, school exams, burn-out at work—the list of causes is virtually endless.\\nStress, in turn, may trigger allergies, asthma, herpes, high cholesterol, and\\nhypertension. It may even lead to a heart condition. It can induce an imbalance of vata,\\npitta, or kapha, depending on the individual’s \\nprakruti\\n (constitution).\\nGenerally, vata individuals are likely to develop vata-aggravated stress reactions,\\nsuch as anxiety or fearfulness, even phobias or anxiety neurosis. Pitta individuals\\nincrease in pitta during stressful situations and typically react to stress in the form of\\nanger. They may also suʃer from hypertension, peptic ulcer, ulcerative colitis, and other\\npitta disorders. Kapha individuals under stress can develop underactive thyroid function,\\nslow metabolism, and even increased blood sugar, leading to a prediabetic condition.\\nThey tend to eat and eat and eat and become chubby.\\nTAKE A RELAXATION BREAK\\n. To prevent the buildup of stress, the ɹrst line of defense is to stay\\ncalm and cool during potentially stressful circumstances. Take long, deep breaths, and\\nbreathe out your stress. Relax. Have a massage, or give yourself an oil massage by\\nrubbing a few ounces of warm oil on your body, from head to toe. Vata individuals\\nshould use sessame oil, pitta individuals sunɻower oil, and kapha individuals corn oil.\\nAfter your massage, take a hot shower or a hot tub bath. Mental techniques such as\\npositive imagery, prayer, singing and chanting, and meditation, as well as regular yoga\\nexercises, are all effective to minimize and remedy stress.\\nANALYZE YOUR STRESS\\n. Separate the things in your life that you ɹnd stressful into two\\ncategories: things you can do something about, and things you can’t. If you can do\\nsomething about it, then do it! If there’s nothing you can do, then surrender to it. Accept\\nit. When there’s nothing I can do about a situation, I have to surrender to it, and in\\naccepting it, there is peace.'),\n",

Many people use large amounts of\\nchemical products on their skin, as well as internally—chemical deodorants, chemical\\nsoaps, chemical perfumes, cough medicines, and numerous other medications. These\\nsubstances all weaken the skin. When a person who uses a large number of these\\nproducts lies in the sun, he or she is more prone to burn.\\nAlso, according to Ayurveda, people of pitta constitution, who are generally more\\nfair-skinned, are more susceptible to sunburn.\\nWhen sunburn is severe, the person may have many symptoms, including dizziness,\\nnausea, blisters, undue sensitivity to light, and peeling of the skin. Repeated sunburn\\nmay create premature aging and wrinkling of the skin, and the person looks old, like a\\nroasted potato!\\nAyurveda has numerous recommendations both to prevent sunburn and to treat it\\neffectively if it happens.\\nTOPICAL REMEDIES TO SOOTHE SUNBURN\\n• Apply aloe vera cream to the site of the burn.

Body, mind, and spirit; work and relationships; diet and the\\nexternal environment; season of the year and daily routine; physical exercise and\\nspiritual practices—all these and many additional factors are treated in the classical\\nAyurvedic texts.\\nFrom our deepest spiritual concerns (Who am I? Where do I come from? What is the\\npurpose of my life?) to the most practical and mundane (How can I heal a sore throat?\\nHow much exercise is best for me? What foods should I eat?), the ɹve-thousand-year-old\\nliving tradition of Ayurveda has answers that are practical and meaningful.\\nAs a system of natural medicine, Ayurveda is not about curing symptoms, although it\\ncertainly accomplishes that. Rather, it is about building a way of life that creates health\\nand healing. To make the best use of Ayurveda—and of this book—you have to put its\\nprinciples into action. Just to run to the remedies section (\\nPart III\\n) when you have a\\nhealth problem is truly to miss the richness and beauty of Ayurveda, which is a complete\\nscience of life that can enable every individual to be healthy and happy.\\nI would not be telling the truth if I said that incorporating Ayurveda into your life is\\ntotally simple. It is not. You will probably have to learn some new principles, as well as\\nunderstanding the nature of your constitution, your mind-body type. It is likely that\\nfrom what you learn, you will want to make changes in your daily routine, such as\\nwaking up earlier or changing the amount and type of exercise that you do. You may\\ndecide it would be wise to modify your diet, perhaps dropping some favorite foods that\\nmay be inappropriate for you. Such changes in our habitual way of living do not happen\\novernight.\\nOn the other hand, I would also not be \\ntelling the truth if I didn’t say that every\\nsmall step you take toward an Ayurvedic lifestyle will have an immediate and positive\\neffect on your body, mind, and consciousness.\\nTo incorporate Ayurveda into your life, you have to start somewhere. Many people\\nɹnd it easiest to begin by following some of the dietary guidelines for their body type.\\nThen gradually, little by little, you can adopt some of the recommendations for the daily\\nroutine, adjusting your daily schedule to be more in tune with nature, or using some of\\nthe suggested breathing exercises or meditation practices.\\nThe underlying assumption of Ayurveda is that each individual has the power to heal\\nhimself or herself.

We can do this by understanding\\nour body and its needs, and by attending to those needs as they change in response to\\nthe ever-changing outer environment and our inner world of feelings. For this,\\nconsciousness is the key: moment-to-moment awareness of what is happening.\\nIn this book, I discuss more than a hundred health conditions, from acne to yeast\\ninfections, from headaches to athlete’s foot. Within those major categories of symptoms,\\nI describe literally hundreds of smaller signs and symptoms. These signs and symptoms\\nare nothing but the body’s language. By presenting us with a headache, diarrhea, fever,\\ntoothache, joint pain, insomnia, emotional anxiety, fear, or insecurity, the body is\\ntalking to us, letting us know that something is wrong, something is out of balance and\\nneeds our attention. It is the language of \\ntridosha\\n, of vata–pitta–kapha.\\nAyurveda says that whatever symptom we experience is an expression of doshic\\nimbalance. To restore good health, we have to reestablish balance by juggling the three\\ndoshas, favoring this one or pacifying that, in order to attain harmony between \\nvikruti\\n,\\nthe present doshic state, and \\nprakruti\\n, the original state of our constitution.\\nAyurveda teaches us how to read this language of signs and symptoms. When, for\\nexample, there are signs of excess heat in the body—skin rash, heartburn, a ɻaring\\ntemper—we know that pitta dosha is in excess and needs to be paciɹed. Similarly, out-\\nof-balance vata may speak to us in terms of insomnia, constipation, or anxiety, while\\nkapha imbalance may communicate its presence as lethargy, overeating, or congestion\\nin the lungs, sinuses, and chest.\\nWe should never disregard this language of \\ntridosha\\n. It is the foundation of health and\\nhappiness, as well as of ill health.\\nIn this book I have tried to share with you how to take care of those symptoms—not\\nsymptomatically but radically, fundamentally, basically. I have tried to show you how to\\nuse the symptoms as a catalyst to reestablish balance within the \\ntridosha\\n, as well as\\nbetween body, mind, and consciousness.\\nBy any method, creating balance within body, mind, and consciousness, and within\\nvata–pitta–kapha, is called healing. The purpose of this book is to help you in your\\nhealing efforts, so that you can attain total health in your life.\\nIn health and healing, there is an equal sharing of responsibility between the\\nphysician \\nand the patient. In this book, really, every reader is taking on both sides of\\nthat responsibility. By using your own insight, perception, observation, and judgment,\\nyou are becoming your own physician and healer. By following the recommendations\\ngiven in this book in order to bring healing, you are taking the role of the patient. You\\nare the healer, and you are the person who receives healing.\\nUse this knowledge well to bring health, harmony, and happiness into your life.'),\n",

That is because all forms of matter, organic and\\ninorganic, are simply the outer manifestations of this most subtle creative energy.\\nMatter is the trapped light of consciousness. The vital force of life ɻows from the\\nuniversal source, the essence of all matter, and manifests in the myriad forms and\\nphenomena of nature.\\nThe classic texts of Ayurveda make it clear that all substances in nature contain this\\ncosmic creative intelligence, and thus have a healing value when used in the proper\\nmanner. That is why, in its quest to create and maintain perfect health, Ayurvedic\\nmedicine makes use of almost everything in nature and in daily life, including food,\\nbreathing, exercise, meditation, relationships, yoga, and massage, as well as regulated\\ndaily and seasonal routines. It also uses thousands of herbs and herbal formulas.\\nIn addition, Ayurveda utilizes the healing properties of metals, gemstones, colors,\\nand aromas. These contain special, potent forms of energy which may be drawn upon\\nfor healing purposes. Most of these methods, clearly described in the ancient textbooks,\\nhave been used safely and successfully for healing for thousands of years, though they\\nhave been scarcely known and little appreciated in the West until very recently. This\\nappendix will provide a brief introduction to these healing modalities.\\nMetals\\nFor medicinal purposes, metals are traditionally processed to be taken internally in\\nsmall doses, after undergoing rigorous and extensive puriɹcation to negate any toxic\\neffects upon the body’s vital organs. The following \\nrecommendations are safe, as they do\\nnot involve ingestion of the actual metal.\\nCOPPER\\nCopper alleviates excess kapha and reduces fat. It is a good tonic for the liver,\\nspleen, and lymphatic system and helps in curing anemia. To treat obesity as well as\\nliver and spleen disorders, thoroughly wash some copper pennies and boil them in a\\nquart of water (or boil a quart of water in a copper vessel) until half the water remains.\\nTake 2 teaspoons of this copper water 3 times a day for a month.

It is also good for weak lungs. Gold can be helpful\\nfor students’ pre-exam tension, for arthritis, and for heart arrhythmia.\\nThe energy of gold may be harnessed by preparing gold medicated water. Use pure\\ngold (24 karat is best), such as a gold band. Place the gold into 2 cups of water, and boil\\nuntil 1 cup evaporates. Take 1 teaspoon of this gold water 2 or 3 times a day to energize\\nthe heart, strengthen mental faculties, and awaken pure awareness. (This process won’t\\nhurt your gold.)\\nYou can also make golden rice. While cooking rice, place a piece of gold in the rice\\npot, and cook as usual. When the rice is finished, remove the gold before serving.\\nNOTE\\n: Gold has heating properties and should be used sparingly by individuals\\nwith a pitta constitution.\\nSILVER\\nSilver has cooling properties and is beneɹcial for treating excess pitta. Silver\\nincreases strength and stamina and is thus helpful for balancing vata. Emaciation,\\nchronic fever and weakness after fever, heartburn, inɻammatory conditions of the\\nintestines, and profuse menstrual bleeding may all be helped by silver. Silver is\\nantiseptic, antibacterial, and disinfectant. Make silver water following the above\\ndirections for gold water, and take 1 teaspoon 2 to 3 times a day. Drink warm milk\\nheated in a silver vessel to build up strength and stamina.\\nIRON\\nThis metal is beneɹcial for bone marrow, bone tissue, liver, and spleen. It increases\\nthe production of red blood cells and helps to cure anemia. Iron also strengthens muscle\\nand nerve tissues and is rejuvenating. For extra iron, try cooking in cast iron pots and\\npans. However, excess iron in the system is harmful, so be careful about using it.\\nAlthough women during their menstruating years may be iron-deɹcient and may beneɹt\\nfrom additional iron, very few men in Western society need extra iron.

It is\\nbeneɹcial to purify any stone before using it. Soaking it for two days in saltwater or\\nmilk should be sufficient. This will not harm the stone.\\n• When you wear a gemstone, it should touch the skin through a small window in the\\nsetting, so that the subtle energies of the stone can interact directly with the energies of\\nthe body.\\n• Where you wear the stone is important. Here are some recommendations:\\ndiamond—ring finger\\npearl—little finger\\nred coral—ring finger\\nemerald—little finger\\nopal—ring finger\\nyellow sapphire—index finger\\nblue sapphire—middle finger\\nAyurveda generally recommends that rings be worn on the right hand, though in the\\nWest, if someone wants to wear their wedding ring on the left hand to conform with\\ntradition, that is all right.\\n• Processed or chemically treated stones may not have the same healing energy. It is\\nbest to get authentic, unprocessed, clean stones without a ɻaw or crack. When you are\\nconsidering buying a stone, be sure to use a magnifying glass to examine it for cracks or\\nimperfections.\\n• Stones should be 3 to 5 karats if possible, but a 1-karat diamond is large enough. A\\nstone that is too small will not produce much of an effect.\\n• Unless you are knowledgeable both in stones and in Vedic astrology \\n(jyotish\\n), it is\\nwise to consult an expert before investing in a stone.

The vehicle varies according to the\\nherb, the illness or condition being treated, your constitution, and other factors.\\nTypically, you might take your herbal dose with a spoonful of ghee or honey; mixed in a\\ncup of warm milk; or placed dry on your tongue and then washed down with some\\nwarm or room-temperature water.\\nMost of the recommendations in this book suggest which vehicle to use. If none is\\nsuggested, use warm water. I do not recommend using capsules because taste is\\nimportant (see \\nthis page\\n), but if you must use them, you can buy some empty 00-size\\nvege-capsules (available at most natural food stores) and ɹll them with the herbal\\nmixture. This is better than not taking the herbs at all, and may be more convenient\\nwhen you are traveling or at work.\\nUSING TRIPHALA\\nTriphala\\n (“the three fruits”) is a wonderful remedy consisting of three of the most\\nimportant Ayurvedic herbs: \\namalaki, bibhitaki\\n, and \\nharitaki. Amalaki\\n works on pitta dosha,\\nbibhitaki\\n on kapha dosha, and \\nharitaki\\n on vata dosha. This compound is rejuvenative and\\nstrengthening for all three doshas and all seven \\ndhatus;\\n it balances \\nojas, tejas\\n, and \\nprana\\nand is also an excellent, mild laxative.\\nTake \\ntriphala\\n in the evening, at least 1 hour after your evening meal. Add ½ to 1\\nteaspoon \\ntriphala\\n powder to about 1 cup boiling water. Steep for 10 minutes or until the\\nwater is cool enough to drink. You may strain out the herbs before drinking or just leave\\nthem at the bottom of your cup.\\nYou may not like the taste of \\ntriphala\\n at ɹrst—it may taste quite bitter. But if you use\\nit regularly, your health is bound to improve, and you will eventually ɹnd that the taste\\nbecomes less unpleasant.'),\n",

If you are one of these people, drink the tea in the morning and it will act in\\nabout one hour.\\n3\\n. \\nIf you really hate the taste, you can mix the \\ntriphala\\n powder with honey and take it\\nthat way.\\nGhee\\nHOW TO MAKE GHEE\\nTwo pounds of butter will make one quart of ghee. Put the butter (sweet and\\nunsalted, organic if available) in a heavy, medium-size pot, turn the heat to medium,\\nand heat until the butter melts, taking care not to burn the butter.\\nThen turn down the heat, cook until the butter just boils, and continue to cook at this\\ntemperature. Do not cover the pot, as it is important to boil the water out and separate\\nthe solids. The butter will foam and sputter for a while and then begin to quiet down.\\nStir it occasionally with a stainless steel spatula, scraping the bottom of the pan.\\nIn 12 to 15 minutes your ghee will begin to smell like popcorn and will turn a lovely\\ngolden color. Whitish curds will form and separate from the clear ghee. When these\\nwhitish curds turn a light tan color and the boiling quiets down, the ghee is ready. Take\\nit oʃ the heat immediately, for it is most likely to burn at this stage. The cooking time\\nshould not be longer than 15 to 20 minutes, depending on the kind of pan and the heat\\nsource.\\nLet the ghee cool until it is just warm. The solid curds will have settled to the bottom\\nof the pot. Decant the clear ghee into a container, and discard the curds left on the\\nbottom.\\nSTORING GHEE\\nGhee can be kept on the kitchen shelf. It does not need refrigeration. Its medicinal\\nproperties are said to improve with age. Don’t ladle out the ghee with a wet spoon or\\nallow any water to get into the container, as this will create the conditions for bacteria\\nto grow and spoil the ghee.\\nEFFECTS OF GHEE'),\n",

It nourishes\\nojas\\n, the subtle essence of all the body’s tissues, strengthens the brain and nervous\\nsystem, and improves memory. It lubricates the connective tissue and makes the body\\nmore ɻexible. Ghee carries the medicinal properties of herbs to all seven \\ndhatus\\n. It\\npacifies pitta and vata and is okay for kapha in moderation.\\nNOTE\\n: People who have high cholesterol or who suʃer from obesity should be\\ncautious about using ghee.\\nHOW TO MAKE MEDICATED GHEES\\nGhee is a highly eʃective \\nanupana\\n (vehicle) for carrying herbs to the deeper tissues of\\nthe body. Hence many remedies are made by cooking herbs into ghee. Examples include\\nshatavari\\n ghee, \\nbrahmi\\n ghee, \\ntikta ghrita\\n (bitter ghee), \\ntriphala\\n ghee, and many others. The\\nprocess is quite lengthy, and you will probably prefer to purchase these medicated ghees\\n(and medicated oils as well). But if you wish to make it yourself, proceed as follows:\\nFirst, make the ghee, as described above.\\nNext, make a decoction of the desired herbs by cooking 1 part dry herbs to 16 parts\\nof water, or about ½ ounce of herbs per cup (8 ounces) of water. Boil the herbs \\nslowly\\nover a low ɻame until the water is reduced to one-quarter its original amount. For\\nexample, 4 cups would be reduced to 1, or 1 cup to ¼ cup. Then strain out the herbs.\\nThis process takes several hours. The liquid can be used as a prepared medicinal\\ndecoction, but in this case, you are going to use it for your medicated ghee.\\nFinally, mix equal parts of ghee and the herbal decoction, and cook it over a low\\nflame until all the water evaporates.\\nMedicated Oils\\nMedicated oils (\\namla\\n oil, \\nbrahmi\\n oil, \\nbhringaraj\\n oil, garlic oil, clove oil, and others) are\\nmade the same way, except that you use oil instead of \\nghee\\n in the final stage.\\nNEEM OIL\\nNeem\\n oil is an herbalized oil made from cooking \\nneem\\n leaves in a base of sesame\\n(usually) or some other oil. It is not pure \\nneem\\n extract, which would be too strong. \\nNeem\\noil is generally available from suppliers of Ayurvedic products.\\nHow Long to Take a Remedy'),\n",

Medicated\\nenemas pacify vata and alleviate many vata disorders, such as constipation, abdominal\\ndistension, insomnia, backache, neck pain, arthritis, sciatica, anxiety, and various\\nnervous disorders. It is said that there are at least eighty vata-related disorders, and that\\nbasti\\n is a complete treatment for 80 percent of them. \\nBasti\\n also is eʃective for treating\\nchronic fever, sexual disorders, kidney stones, hyperacidity, and numerous other\\nconditions.\\nNOTE\\n: Medicated enemas are not to be used by anyone suʃering from diarrhea,\\nbleeding from the rectum, indigestion, cough, breathlessness, ascites, profuse\\nedema, or active hemorrhoids.

The stomach should be empty,\\nso wait at least three hours after eating. Make sure the environment is clean, warm, and\\ncomfortable: An area where you can lie down near the toilet is best. You will need an\\nenema bag or syringe, a measuring cup, a hot plate or stove (this doesn’t have to be in\\nthe bathroom!), the oil and/or herbal substance, and towels.\\nThe usual procedure for \\nbasti\\n is ɹrst to introduce 5 ounces of warm (not hot) sesame\\noil into the rectum and retain it for 10 minutes. Then, without expelling the oil,\\nintroduce a mixture of oil and herbal tea and retain it for at least 30 minutes. The\\nmixture should consist of another 5 ounces of sesame oil, mixed with 16 ounces (1 pint)\\nof tea made from herbs steeped in hot water, then strained and cooled to about body\\ntemperature.
