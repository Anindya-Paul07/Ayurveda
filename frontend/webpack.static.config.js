// This configuration file has been removed as part of the migration to a React-based SPA.
// The chat functionality previously built with this config has been refactored into 
// the React component: ChatComponent.jsx
// 
// If you need to process any legacy static assets in the future,
// you can create a new webpack configuration as needed.
